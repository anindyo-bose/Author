    <h1>I,Pebble</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I am a pebble.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I’m mostly orange-brown but there’s a gorgeous blue streak across one side which I think lends me a rather dashing appearance. Which also caused me to be separated from my family, I suspect.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I used to be a happy little stone basking in the sun beside the gurgling river along with plentiful of my family members, occasionally doused by the cold water rushing by and then drying out either in the sun or by the cold wind and sometimes by both.
      At times, we would get tossed further down the river too… we mostly passed time admiring the sights and gassing about really old times. Then one day, a small girl came along with her family near the river bank and my life changed forever.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was a cold, sunny afternoon when a car stopped by the river and a family stepped out, stretching and twisting, easing their limbs of the tiring drive downhill. A youngish couple and two kids, a small girl, and a smaller boy. I watched with interest
      as I find humans peculiar. Since the road was only a short height above the riverbank, the family stepped gingerly onto the rocks at the edge and came closer to the river, a few steps from where I lay. The couple found a dry spot and sat there,
      stretching out their legs. The woman kept her young son in her lap but let the daughter amuse herself close by. I watched her father keep an eye on her.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The girl skipped around for a bit, chucking pebbles in the river and chuckling loudly at the plops they made. This went on for some time when their driver hailed them, gesturing for them to return to the car and presumably carry on with their journey.
      </P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The girl had just chucked another stone, and picked me up, giggling to herself, vastly amused. Just as I was bracing myself to be dunked into the cold rushing water, her mother called her.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Polly! We’ve to go, baby! Come!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">And Polly ran after her parents, still clutching me in her hand. My journey to the wide unknown had begun.</P>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The Khannas lived in a nice apartment from what I could make out. I learnt later that the city was Delhi. Initially, Polly’s mother, Dilpreet, wasn’t too keen to keep me at home. She tried talking Polly out of it but she, jolly girl, stuck by me,
        and seeing her determined to keep me, her father, Harpal, pitched in for her. So Dilpreet bought a large glass bowl, poured loads of pebbles into it, who I then joined.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Look at the orange stone, momma… it’s so beautiful! I’ll keep it in the middle!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">And I got the pride of place in that bowl.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Life was steady there. Days blurred into nights, scorching summers into pleasant winters and Polly was soon a teenager while her brother, Dingo, was a naughty ten-year-old. I had grown to quite like my spot in the jar, surrounded by my cousins from
        some sea I believe, who, though, spoke little. Every morning a beam of sun angled into our corner and it refreshed me. I missed my river buddies but well, I consoled myself, what could I do about that?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">One evening, when the parents were out and Polly was on a school trip, Dingo returned from his evening out playing cricket. He fancied himself a batsman and practised swinging his bat inside the apartment. That evening he was practising in the broad
        corridor that perpendicularly bordered the living room, gently hitting a tennis ball that he had coaxed the live-in maid to bowl at him. Well, you can keep a ten-year-old quiet only for so long. Suddenly, he unleashed a shot and the ball screamed
        in and smashed my home to smithereens.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I crashed to the ground along with my cousins, scattering all over the floor. As I lay stunned—and free—I watched Dingo gaping wide-eyed at the disaster he had wrought while the maid was almost in tears for it had happened under her watch. Soon
        she swept all of us pebbles together and kept aside in a pile, and the glass pieces in a paper bag.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I soon found myself dumped somewhere on the road along with the others. Polly’s mom decided, after the initial recriminations, it would be tiresome to reset us again in a new jar. And Polly? I suppose her teenage self had moved on. ‘Whatever’ was
        her only comment when Dilpreet announced her decision.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">So there we were, the glum chums and I, in the glare of the Delhi sun, scorched to our core. Over the next weeks and months, our band depleted as urchins and ragpickers, general passers-by and other riff-raff, picked up and threw us apart. One day,
        it was my turn.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A gap-toothed youngster in rags picked me up, all the while howling with laughter, aimed, and threw me at his companion at a distance. As I sailed across towards the targeted boy, I saw he was of the similar age and appearance as my thrower. I slammed
        into target-boy, uncannily accurately, right in his stomach and then bounced off and lay still on the ground, wondering what next!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Wait until I crack you on your nut!” he screamed and picked me up. Once more I sailed across at the first boy. Was this my fate now?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">But that boy proved to be more agile, ducking easily and letting me fly over him towards what, I saw, was a wall. I bounced on its top—ouch—and then tipped over, landing on grass but the momentum caused me to bounce again from there onto the road
        that lay immediately next to the grass verge.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Oh well. Now what?</P>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was a busy road. All types of vehicles were passing by, large, many-wheeled ones, smaller ones with four wheels, often interspersed with spindly two-wheeled ones. I was kicked around soon after landing there: spit by one tyre, squirted by another,
        pinched by the next, until I was disoriented and far away from where I had landed.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">An odd gap in my travels let me catch my breath. I saw I was still lying on a wide road that seemed to go on for miles in every direction. It was lonely despite the traffic and incredibly, I missed my glum chum cousins of the jar. And in this spot
        of crowded loneliness my looks mattered not.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Suddenly, a tyre of a small truck ran over me, wedging me firmly into a tread mark. Despite turning rapidly over and over as the truck went along the road, I remained jammed in tight. Willy-nilly, I was off for I knew not where.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">By the time we stopped, I was dizzy from all the whirling and still stuck in the tyre anyway. From what I could make out, we were in a narrow lane and I could see some buildings on one side. Meanwhile, a few men started unloading furniture and stuff
        from the truck, shouting and cursing. They’re soon done and climbed back on the truck. As it rolled back a bit to swerve from behind a parked car in front, my tyre rolled over a half-brick, loosening the rubber a bit, and out I popped.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I found myself in a narrow, blind lane, with buildings on both sides and several cars parked along one. The lane itself appeared to be almost unpaved and filled with my distant cousins, rough gravels, half-stuck there.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Okay, I said to myself. This could be interesting. There were bound to be people and in such close quarters I could perhaps hear their usual interesting gossip.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Over the months and years that passed subsequently, I moved positions many times, often thrown or kicked by kids, or spit by vehicle tyres, or swept by the sweepers but remained somewhere or the other in that lane. My perspective altered, my observations
        accumulated; I now knew quite a few of the people having overheard them. Some were life’s grumblers, some so reserved that I still didn’t know the sound of their voice, while some were lively and some, inveterate gossips. The other favourite of
        mine were the few pets, mostly dogs, that the family helps brought out daily for their airings. These pets dashed about the place, often joined by the neighbourhood kids in their play in the evenings, while their mothers gathered for their daily
        dose of gossip.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The other loose stones, gravel and the few pebbles were mostly not very chatty and I had to poke them to have any conversations. The dust and general grime was such that I could barely recognize myself. Only when it rained did I feel cleansed of
        it. And if it rained, the lane got water-logged… dirty water-logged. Oh well, that’s life.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">One evening, when I lay at a recently kicked-to spot, a lady and her fat husband walked by, the lady complaining that the puppy that used to live in their building had vanished.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Where do you think it went?” she asked him.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The husband, adopting the pontificating tone husbands do when they can get away with it, said, “When you’ve a puppy that belongs to no one specifically in our building, be sure it’d run away when an opportunity arose… That’s what it did…”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The wife sounded indignant. “Why should it run away? It was being fed by someone or the other… oh poor thing! I miss it!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Well, if it feels like coming back it will…” the husband said comfortingly.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“I wish…” Their voice faded as they walked away but my mind was alive! I wanted to scream after them, “I know where the puppy went! It didn’t run away! It was taken in a car by that other lady in the afternoon… and it wasn’t with her when she returned!
        She must have disposed of it somewhere!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was privy to many such happenings as I lay there, curious, and watchful. I knew who had scratched a certain car out of spite or had let air out of a tyre or two. I had seen a young man from a flat splash paint on the wall of the house opposite
        after a fight for parking. The victim perhaps suspected but could prove nothing. I watched with great interest at a young man mooning over a young girl, never quite nerving himself up to the challenge of speaking to her despite the girl showing
        interest as well. I wished them well but saw no progress to my great disappointment.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A few days passed since the disappearance of the puppy when one late afternoon, a young boy dashed by with the same puppy cuddled in his arms. Alarmed, I checked. Yes, the puppy was alive but appeared weak and injured.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The boy stopped and asked a small boy playing there, “This is Blackie! Who should I give him to?”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I’d seen the rescuer-boy in the lane often enough, but he didn’t live there. He’s probably a student who took tuitions at a local tutor’s.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The little boy smiled widely—for Blackie was a popular puppy—and said, “Take him to the aunty on the second floor!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That, I thought, would be the same lady who had been complaining to her husband about the missing puppy. Good!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The young boy was back soon, glowing with the pleasure that comes from doing a good deed, and was surrounded by a bunch of local kids, excited and happy that Blackie was back. I sighed. That was a bit of all right.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That same night, a series of bizarre incidents again redirected my life. A large SUV came by and dropped some folks off. As it reversed to leave, one of its rather large wheels rolled over me and hey, I stuck in a tyre tread.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Help! I was leaving there!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My reticent neighbouring gravel finally spoke up. “Hello! You’re leaving?” he exclaimed.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Before I’d reply, the SUV rolled off and as before, I was firmly ensconced in that groove.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">We kept going for long, passing through busy streets, then busy roads, until traffic thinned out, the roads broadened and the SUV picked up more speed. I felt dizzy and wanted to get off but that seemed like a remote possibility. We went on.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Suddenly, I felt the vehicle rolling to a stop, and at the last second, another pebble squeezed into my groove causing me to pop out.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Hello! Been here long?” was its cordial greeting but I couldn’t stop to reply; I dropped to the ground.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was still dark. The road curved gently to the right from where I lay, splotches of light cast by the streetlamps curving along with. There was a roadside tea shack where the SUV gang had presumably gone to refresh themselves. What did fate have
        in store for me?</P>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Hours passed. The sky was turning light, early morning mist cast an almost ethereal beauty to the surroundings, giving the plentiful trees a mysterious air. The cries of birds added to the beauty of the moment. The SUV was long gone. Traffic was
        sparse, a few men walked past. I felt refreshed.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Time passed and the sun grew stronger, melting away the mist, bringing everything to a harsher light, harsher reality. I sighed to myself on the passing of the moment.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">But time marches on! Cars whizzed by as did the larger vehicles. I saw a man walking at a distance, coming towards me. As he came closer I saw he was shabbily dressed, tired, dragging his steps, carrying a lunchbox in his hand. Probably a night
        guard returning home?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Behind the man, at some distance, came a three-wheeled van, travelling at speed. The man had crossed me, shuffling along, when the van also passed me and hit the man hard from behind, tossing him up in the air. The van screeched to a halt a short
        distance away and the driver stepped out. Meanwhile, the victim lay on the road, writhing in pain, moaning, blood pouring from his many wounds. The van driver stepped in close to the victim, warily, and looked all around: there was none. He bent
        over the wounded man, and incredibly enough, unclasped his cheap wristwatch and quickly pocketed it. Then he sprinted back to his van and drove off.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I lay aghast. I willed to yell in anger and disbelief. I’d hoped the driver would take the victim to some hospital but he stole from him instead! I looked around in frustration for someone, anyone, to help the poor man squirming in pain. Cars whizzed
        by but none stopped. Surely, they could see a man cloaked in blood lying helplessly on the road? Why didn’t they stop?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Sometime later, when the man was lying still, a bus stopped at the tea shack, off the road. As the passengers alighted, someone noticed the wounded man lying still on the road, only metres away. He ran there along with a few others. They surrounded
        him and then suddenly someone said, “He’s alive!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Quick, call an ambulance!” another man cried.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I could weep tears of joy. The first man called for the police and an ambulance, bless his soul. By the time the passengers were done with their tea break, the ambulance and a police jeep had arrived. The victim was soon despatched in the ambulance
        and the bus passengers boarded the bus. I lay happy… for there was still hope!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The bus rolled back and lo! One of the rear wheels went over me and I was back in the familiar spot, a tyre tread groove! Snug as a bug, my journey started soon. The whims of a rolling wheel could deposit me wherever and I determined to face my
        fate as it came. Dizzy and woozy though I felt with all the whirling, I was content.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As the miles rolled away and the hours passed, I sensed a change in altitude. It was cooler, the road appeared a little narrower, the turns more frequent. Maybe I’d guess where we were if the bus would only stop for a break…? But we kept going.
        After another few hours maybe, a sudden bump on the road caused me to be spit out of my groove.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I skittered along for a distance as the bus bowled away. Coming to a stop finally, I gathered my wits and noticed I was on a narrow road that lay ribbon-like, snaking down on one end, and up the other. To my right rose the sheer sides of a mountain.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Then I noticed I was close to the left edge of the road and on that side, it was a drop to the bank of a river. I could see the river gurgling along swiftly, majestically. And on the bank of the river lay my brethren, by the thousands, gleaming
        wetly, cheerily, calling me over.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Only then I sensed the cool breeze blowing, the raw beauty of nature all around. Rocky hills with startlingly green patches, sparkling, tumbling water flowing swiftly, and my lost riverbank of so many years. I was back! Just a foot away lay the
        drop to my family’s lap… if only someone could toss me over! There… there at a distance I could see a local woman and her small son walking up the hill road. Wouldn’t the boy do what boys do? Pick me up and plop me into the river?</P>

        it. And if it rained, the lane got water-logged… dirty water-logged. Oh well, that’s life.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">One evening, when I lay at a recently kicked-to spot, a lady and her fat husband walked by, the lady complaining that the puppy that used to live in their building had vanished.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">“Where do you think it went?” she asked him.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The husband, adopting the pontificating tone husbands do when they can get away with it, said, “When you’ve a puppy that belongs to no one specifically in our building, be sure it’d run away when an opportunity arose… That’s what it did…”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The wife sounded indignant. “Why should it run away? It was being fed by someone or the other… oh poor thing! I miss it!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">“Well, if it feels like coming back it will…” the husband said comfortingly.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">“I wish…” Their voice faded as they walked away but my mind was alive! I wanted to scream after them, “I know where the puppy went! It didn’t run away! It was taken in a car by that other lady in the afternoon… and it wasn’t with her when she returned!
        She must have disposed of it somewhere!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I was privy to many such happenings as I lay there, curious, and watchful. I knew who had scratched a certain car out of spite or had let air out of a tyre or two. I had seen a young man from a flat splash paint on the wall of the house opposite
        after a fight for parking. The victim perhaps suspected but could prove nothing. I watched with great interest at a young man mooning over a young girl, never quite nerving himself up to the challenge of speaking to her despite the girl showing
        interest as well. I wished them well but saw no progress to my great disappointment.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">A few days passed since the disappearance of the puppy when one late afternoon, a young boy dashed by with the same puppy cuddled in his arms. Alarmed, I checked. Yes, the puppy was alive but appeared weak and injured.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The boy stopped and asked a small boy playing there, “This is Blackie! Who should I give him to?”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I’d seen the rescuer-boy in the lane often enough, but he didn’t live there. He’s probably a student who took tuitions at a local tutor’s.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The little boy smiled widely—for Blackie was a popular puppy—and said, “Take him to the aunty on the second floor!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">That, I thought, would be the same lady who had been complaining to her husband about the missing puppy. Good!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The young boy was back soon, glowing with the pleasure that comes from doing a good deed, and was surrounded by a bunch of local kids, excited and happy that Blackie was back. I sighed. That was a bit of all right.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">That same night, a series of bizarre incidents again redirected my life. A large SUV came by and dropped some folks off. As it reversed to leave, one of its rather large wheels rolled over me and hey, I stuck in a tyre tread.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Help! I was leaving there!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">My reticent neighbouring gravel finally spoke up. “Hello! You’re leaving?” he exclaimed.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Before I’d reply, the SUV rolled off and as before, I was firmly ensconced in that groove.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">We kept going for long, passing through busy streets, then busy roads, until traffic thinned out, the roads broadened and the SUV picked up more speed. I felt dizzy and wanted to get off but that seemed like a remote possibility. We went on.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Suddenly, I felt the vehicle rolling to a stop, and at the last second, another pebble squeezed into my groove causing me to pop out.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">“Hello! Been here long?” was its cordial greeting but I couldn’t stop to reply; I dropped to the ground.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">It was still dark. The road curved gently to the right from where I lay, splotches of light cast by the streetlamps curving along with. There was a roadside tea shack where the SUV gang had presumably gone to refresh themselves. What did fate have
        in store for me?</P>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Hours passed. The sky was turning light, early morning mist cast an almost ethereal beauty to the surroundings, giving the plentiful trees a mysterious air. The cries of birds added to the beauty of the moment. The SUV was long gone. Traffic was
        sparse, a few men walked past. I felt refreshed.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Time passed and the sun grew stronger, melting away the mist, bringing everything to a harsher light, harsher reality. I sighed to myself on the passing of the moment.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">But time marches on! Cars whizzed by as did the larger vehicles. I saw a man walking at a distance, coming towards me. As he came closer I saw he was shabbily dressed, tired, dragging his steps, carrying a lunchbox in his hand. Probably a night
        guard returning home?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Behind the man, at some distance, came a three-wheeled van, travelling at speed. The man had crossed me, shuffling along, when the van also passed me and hit the man hard from behind, tossing him up in the air. The van screeched to a halt a short
        distance away and the driver stepped out. Meanwhile, the victim lay on the road, writhing in pain, moaning, blood pouring from his many wounds. The van driver stepped in close to the victim, warily, and looked all around: there was none. He bent
        over the wounded man, and incredibly enough, unclasped his cheap wristwatch and quickly pocketed it. Then he sprinted back to his van and drove off.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I lay aghast. I willed to yell in anger and disbelief. I’d hoped the driver would take the victim to some hospital but he stole from him instead! I looked around in frustration for someone, anyone, to help the poor man squirming in pain. Cars whizzed
        by but none stopped. Surely, they could see a man cloaked in blood lying helplessly on the road? Why didn’t they stop?</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Sometime later, when the man was lying still, a bus stopped at the tea shack, off the road. As the passengers alighted, someone noticed the wounded man lying still on the road, only metres away. He ran there along with a few others. They surrounded
        him and then suddenly someone said, “He’s alive!”</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">“Quick, call an ambulance!” another man cried.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I could weep tears of joy. The first man called for the police and an ambulance, bless his soul. By the time the passengers were done with their tea break, the ambulance and a police jeep had arrived. The victim was soon despatched in the ambulance
        and the bus passengers boarded the bus. I lay happy… for there was still hope!</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The bus rolled back and lo! One of the rear wheels went over me and I was back in the familiar spot, a tyre tread groove! Snug as a bug, my journey started soon. The whims of a rolling wheel could deposit me wherever and I determined to face my
        fate as it came. Dizzy and woozy though I felt with all the whirling, I was content.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">As the miles rolled away and the hours passed, I sensed a change in altitude. It was cooler, the road appeared a little narrower, the turns more frequent. Maybe I’d guess where we were if the bus would only stop for a break…? But we kept going.
        After another few hours maybe, a sudden bump on the road caused me to be spit out of my groove.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I skittered along for a distance as the bus bowled away. Coming to a stop finally, I gathered my wits and noticed I was on a narrow road that lay ribbon-like, snaking down on one end, and up the other. To my right rose the sheer sides of a mountain.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Then I noticed I was close to the left edge of the road and on that side, it was a drop to the bank of a river. I could see the river gurgling along swiftly, majestically. And on the bank of the river lay my brethren, by the thousands, gleaming
        wetly, cheerily, calling me over.</P>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Only then I sensed the cool breeze blowing, the raw beauty of nature all around. Rocky hills with startlingly green patches, sparkling, tumbling water flowing swiftly, and my lost riverbank of so many years. I was back! Just a foot away lay the
        drop to my family’s lap… if only someone could toss me over! There… there at a distance I could see a local woman and her small son walking up the hill road. Wouldn’t the boy do what boys do? Pick me up and plop me into the river?</P>
