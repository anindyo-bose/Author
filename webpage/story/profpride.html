    <h1>Professional Pride</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Not a paisa more!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The stridency of the voice, speaking in Hindi, struck me even as I passed by a couple, the man arguing with a <i>coolie</i>. I glanced at the clean-shaven man; he was gesticulating angrily while the tall, dark and gloriously moustachioed porter stood with his palms turned out in conciliatory gesture, arguing his point with languid moves. I hurried on, a smile tugging at my mouth. The couple had too much luggage to really argue and settle on a 'bargain'.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Such scenes invariably give me a sense of self-satisfaction. I believe in travelling light. To wit, even then I had just a trolley-type small case—what they called, pretty artfully I thought, a <i>strolley—</i>that had been enough for the little job I had been visiting Calcutta for. With perhaps a jauntier step, I hurried toward the board displaying the out-bound trains.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">At any given time of the day, the Howrah (no, I cannot bring myself to spell it the new way: 'Haora'; all sense of romance is lost!) station resembles a madhouse gone crazy. Frenzied people any which way you glance. Harried fathers either giving in or giving it to their younger versions; mothers similarly attempting to put sense into theirs. When not in families, then singly, or in groups, people rushing each way madly, hawkers trying hopefully to draw attention to their variety of wares, insinuating themselves wanted or otherwise. Railway officials going about their own somnolent business, general gawkers gawking, beggars begging. Islands of people, in sharp contradistinction, standing motionless amidst the tumult, just gossiping, laying bare all matters under discussion with their sabre-sharp but impotent wit. In general, Howrah station looked just like it always does: itself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Pushing past a man trying to pass through exactly where I was, I managed a glimpse of the 'Departure' board. A sea of heads, bobbing up and down, was before me, effectively making the board a pretty psychedelic display for me: here now, gone next! I am not a tall man you see.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I used my patent leather shoe to effectively squash a foot that, being attached to a man in front of me who was about a foot taller, hindered my sight of the board. A suave "excuse me!" and I had won through. Aah, much better!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">'Howrah Delhi Kalka Mail' was marked for platform number 14, scheduled to depart within the next ten minutes. A few more trodden feet, muttered excuses, one or two muffled oaths from the sufferers and I was out of that sea, heading fast for my train.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Platform 14 was a continuation of the madness of the main station. Dodging and weaving, I made for my compartment, A2. In the olden days I guess I would have said the train stood huffing and puffing. Now it merely wheezed. With a grin, I trotted on, blessing the railways for putting air-conditioned coaches closer to the head of the platform.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Providence, no doubt aided and abetted by the railway booking clerk in no small measure, had allocated me a lower berth, number 19. Sighing with relief, I stowed away my valise under the berth and sat down. I mopped my brow—although late October, the heat built up when one walked briskly—and tried to sense the cooling air supposedly flowing from the vents above.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Possibly seeing me look up, the passenger opposite me—at first glance, most ordinary looking a chap—smiled and spoke in <i>Bangla</i>.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, it is on. But the coolth will strike you only a little later." He smiled engagingly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"<i>Coolth</i>...?" I looked askance. He had spoken that in English. Or whatever language he deemed that to be.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The man looked satisfied. I had spotted the word he had so casually tossed at me. "Oh, just like 'warmth'! 'Coolth' lends such an apt completeness to an inadequate 'coolness'..." He smirked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Oh...", I muttered. I looked away, thinking, "Oh, he is <i>that</i> kind of a man, a <i>language</i> wit! Sure to push such gems on the others in the course of the journey..." A flash of my temper flared but I controlled it quickly. <i>This was no way to start a journey</i>, I told myself sternly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There were just the two of us yet; two more passengers were to be expected. I looked at my watch. Whoever they were, they were surely not going to make it! Across the narrow aisle I noticed a lady sitting, reading a book. She appeared professorial; thick glasses with a neck-strap, grey hair, severely pulled back, and the corners of her mouth turned down. A vivid image spilled into my mind: <i>All she needs is a sharp...</i> I shook my head brusquely. This was not good at all!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Just as I thought I would pay a covert glance at the wit, I heard that strident voice, "<i>Not</i> this one, the next one! I told you!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Aah, my friends! They were also travelling with me? My mood swung in anticipated curiosity. The gloriously moustachioed porter appeared first, almost staggering under two large suitcases on his head, and slung on his arms were an assortment of smaller bags.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes! That's it! Stop there!" The voice preceded the man himself. The porter had stopped right in front of us. He looked at us and then at the lady across the aisle. She didn't look up.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"20 and 24, those are the berths," the strident one said. To be honest, his voice had toned down considerably. "20 on the right and 24 on the... left?" The bewilderment in his voice was so achingly innocent!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"How can they do this? Morons!" He glared at the wit, who looked at him and smiled gently.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The glare focussed on me next. I stared back. He said, "How very convenient! My wife has a berth at 20, an upper one and I have been given that one, across!" He pointed with his thumb at the berth above the professorial lady. The injustice seemed to burn him up.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The porter had meanwhile managed to stow away all the pieces of luggage and quite understandably, sought his dues.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Sahib, please check your luggage."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The strident one looked shocked at the interruption. As if noticing the porter for the first time, he said, "Eh? Oh! Here, take the money and vanish!" He took out his wallet and put some notes in the porter's hands. The porter had possibly made an astute estimation that further wheedling was not certain to yield too favourable results. He kept mum and loped away.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was only now that the woman—the strident one's wife presumably—appeared in front of us. A strikingly beautiful lady, tall and with very black hair in perfect coiffure, and wearing what seemed to be a silk <i>sari</i>, stood demurely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You take this berth, eh, Savita?" The strident one—okay, so I still did not know his name—said indicating the berth above the professorial lady. The latter looked at Savita and scowled. Then he noticed there was another as yet unoccupied in our section. He motioned peremptorily at the wit, "What is your berth number?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">You had to hand it to the wit; he remained calm despite that tone. "21", he replied.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This irritating man was going to get it in the neck, I thought, knowing he would now turn to me. He turned. I knew I didn't want to listen to that tone—and be held responsible for my reaction. So I said without being asked, "Mine is 19. Mr 22 is yet to arrive."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The strident man looked a bit nonplussed. "Er, hmmm", he grunted.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He quickly proceeded to occupy berth number 22. "Savita," he said, "you move to this berth. Whoever was supposed to come for this berth is surely not making it for it's almost time for departure. Even if that fellow arrives I will ask him to take number 24."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That irked me some more. I did a few quick deep breaths, hoping to work out my irritation.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This couple was settling in and I was expecting the train to start moving any moment when the missing person, the sixth passenger in our compartment, actually arrived.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He was panting, sweating badly, and patches of it cast strange patterns on his shirt. He stood there mopping his forehead, smiling apologetically; a small, tubby clean-shaven man, bald, with only a fringe of wispy hair around the back of his head. He was wearing a pair of off-white trousers and a gray shirt, and was dragging along a very similar looking strolley. But all these observations were automatic, without any effort from my side. My eyes were riveted at the man's face, my mind frozen numb, incapable of any rational thought! I realised in a vague way that my right hand was half-way to my chin to scratch and was shaking uncontrollably. I was in shock.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">You see, earlier in the day, about three hours back, I had shot him dead with my rifle. The little job I had come to Calcutta for, you know.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Without realising I got up and tottered off, vaguely shaking a hand at the wit who was asking me something. I walked down the aisle towards the exit in a daze, mind whirling. Meanwhile the train started to move, and I lurched in response, clutching a berth to steady myself. Then I was out into the cramped space around the toilets. The metal doors were shut. I opened one and the sudden rush of wind kind of awakened me from the daze. I gripped the side bars at the entrance and hung out a bit, feeling the wind blow into my face as the train gathered pace. It felt a bit better.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A sudden vision of that man's bald head as it had appeared through the telescopic sight of my rifle, just a fraction of a second before a red flower had bloomed on its crown, caused me to grimace tightly. And I felt an arm tighten around my middle and a man saying, "<i>Kya sahib, gir jaoge</i>!" "Sir, you will fall!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I moved back in and noticed this man to be the coach attendant. He was now asking me if I was well. I said I was and sat on the small seat there meant for the attendant. I drew a cigarette out and lit up. The attendant shut the door and went off, no doubt to gossip.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had accepted this little job about a week back. In my usual circuitous manner, I had received the envelope with the target's photograph, on the back of which was his name and address. My policy being never to travel directly to the target site, I had hopped across several towns over three days and made my way to Calcutta. I had done my surveillance work over the subsequent three days, establishing the target's—I never think of them as people, it helps in my line of work, you see—schedule, idiosyncrasies, if any; any pattern that he followed and then picked the actual spot for the act, and scouted for a reasonably good spot—there is almost never a 'perfect' one, despite what you might read or hear—to shoot from.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I shot the target late in the afternoon outside his office, just as the rush hour was starting. I had noticed he stepped out for a cigarette around that time, before going back in for a final thirty minutes until closing time. I had made myself comfortable on the roof of a rooming house across that was mostly vacant at that hour. The roof remained empty till about early evening and there were plenty of staircases which increased the chance of escape pretty well.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I sighted my rifle through the narrow openings in the cemented railing on the roof. Using the head of the peon, a young lad of about twenty, who stood outside the target's office, I adjusted the scope until I could see each individual hair there. Then I waited, keeping a lookout through the scope. It was a simple matter. Eventually the target stepped out, bald head shining, stretched, and took out his cigarette pack.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Smoking kills, my friend," I muttered, while focussing on the crown of his bald pate. The skin came up clear. I could see some tiny hair and the shine of oil; apparently, he nursed it in the hope of coaxing some hair to grow back! I was grinning when I pulled the trigger and watched the red flower blooming for a second before I started collapsing and packing the rifle in about 7 seconds. I was off from the roof in less than 15 seconds. I had not waited to see him collapsing on the street.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I went down the three floors rapidly, the small backpack slung over my shoulder. The gun, you see, collapses into a 14-inch, four section pack, possible to be neatly hidden in a soft cloth bag or backpack. I used a parallel lane to exit to the main road from where I took a taxi to my nondescript hotel in Dharmatolla. I did not notice any excitement around that rooming house as I was leaving, but then it was too soon for that, wasn't it?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I checked out of the hotel, exactly per plan, and took a cab to the station.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My cigarette was out I realised, awaking from my brief reverie. This was inexplicable! I had actually seen the blood on that man's head and yet... there he was, hale and hearty, if a bit out of breath! For the life of me I could not understand the scenario at all. I considered the facts:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Had I hit the target who I was supposed to? Of course. I had looked at his bald head from up so close that I could even see the sparse hair on it.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Had the bullet hit? Yes! I had seen the red flower bloom. No doubt.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Does a .22 kill a man? Yes, it does, when fired with precision, as I had.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Could he have collapsed, injured, but not died? Remote chance, but possible nevertheless. But certainly, he couldn't have sprinted and caught a train 3 hours later!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Was I seeing a different man on the train actually? No! I was quite certain it was the same man, my target, who I had studied so very closely in the photograph and then in person, from a distance.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Did the target have a twin? Very <i>filmi</i> but a chance nonetheless. Three arguments militated against this:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">o    If such were the case, my client would likely have warned me of it. After all he would gain nothing by having the wrong man die.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">o    But certainly, a brother couldn't just dump a dead twin and catch a train to some place! I mean, not in the likelihood, right?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">o    In my three days of surveillance surely the twin would have surfaced? But what if he was travelling and had just returned?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had lit up a second cigarette while doing some tense thinking. Breaking that chain of thought I found it had gone out again. As I relit it, the wit came out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You've been away for so long I thought you had left!" He was smiling. "Also, don't you want to place your order for dinner? The pantry car fellow is collecting orders now... if you like I could place one for you..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Eh? No, no... I had stepped out merely for a smoke." I realised I was not prepared to handle sudden queries. But this man was certainly quite helpful... "That would be very helpful of you. Could you please tell him I would prefer a non-vegetarian meal? Thank you very much!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The wit continued in <i>Bangla</i>. "No problem, no problem! You come in and we can chat until dinner is served, what do you say?" His insufferable bonhomie was irritating me nevertheless and in my current state I worried I could be easily provoked into something I would regret later. I composed myself with some effort.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You go on ahead. I will use the toilet and join you." I smiled lamely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Good!" He smiled—apparently this fellow just never ran out of his good humour—and went back inside. And I stepped into the toilet cubicle. I had no urge; just a few more minutes to compose myself and face the man who ought to have been getting ready to be cremated.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">What after all was I supposed to do? My professional pride was severely stung, I acknowledged that. But the very mystery and the sheer impossibility of the situation had seriously rattled me, I had to admit. And of course, the consequences of failure had not escaped me either. You see, my line of work is based on word of mouth, and failure is sure to reduce a professional like me to obscurity and very quickly at that. My clients paid my rate only because I delivered every time. Often there were referrals. I had spoken to this client only once, over the phone—since I never meet face to face—and he had agreed to pay my price without a murmur. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My charges are not fixed. I look at the target, the location, quantum of probable risk, besides plenty of other factors. I generally ask the prospective client what he would lose if the target were to continue living. Most beat about the bush but revealed enough for me to sense the degree of desperation. And that helped me determine my fees.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There is no mechanism for returning fees in this business. Sure, my client could contact me the same way he had the first time and demand his money back. I squirmed in anticipated embarrassment. So, what could I do? The obvious answer was to complete the assignment.  But here, on the train? I wasn't prepared! I hadn't worked out the risks and neither their mitigation!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I looked at my watch; it was another 10 minutes since the time I had entered the toilet. If I didn't head back I was sure the wit would be back looking for me. With a final deep breath, I left there.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">When I reached there I found my co-passengers had rearranged themselves somewhat. The beautiful woman's strident husband was occupying my seat by the window; the wit was in his own, opposite him. Savita, the beautiful woman, was sitting prettily in the aisle seat opposite the professorial lady. And the man who had defied my carefully placed bullet in his head was sitting in his own seat, number 22. It was opposite him that I had now to sit since the strident one was in mine. I was in no mood to argue and just sat down in the only vacant seat.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The wit smiled a "welcome back". I had to return it as well. I was wondering what to say when he started.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Finally!" His genial tone was of course to be expected. "We were all wondering where you had gone off!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Oh just for a smoke, y'know." I was managing a fair nonchalance. But I also wanted to steer the conversation away from my abrupt departure. "When is dinner?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The bald man—he who had denied me peace of mind since his advent— who had been struggling with setting up his mobile to be charged, spoke up, "Yes, I really am hungry. All that running has really worked up my appetite!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">His mood seemed ebullient, as if designed to provoke me. The strident one was quiet, peering out of the nearly-opaque window into the dark night outside.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"So, how far are you travelling?" The wit was looking at me quite pleasantly. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Kanpur." That was of course not my destination, just my first point to change trains, onwards to my final destination in my customary circuitous manner, according to my plan.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Hmm... around tomorrow noon is your arrival then." He smiled. "We might as well spend the time more companionably, what do you say?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The innate friendliness of the man was insufferable, but I had to keep my cool.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The wit spoke again, "Kanpur. I am getting off there too. Do you stay there, Mr ..er...?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My response to fill-in the gap was automatic. "Dey, Rathin Dey. Yes, I live there. And you?" I gulped some water down.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I belong there but live in Kolkata." He smiled broadly. For the first time I noticed the perfect symmetry of his face. The high forehead, greying sideburns, and his mellifluous voice projected an image of quiet assurance, of command. His smile had the quality of winning people over. "And my name is Bisheswar Upadhyay."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Since each one of us had been speaking in <i>Bangla</i>, his name came as a minor surprise. His <i>Bangla</i> sounded perfect. The man who refused to die complimented him.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You speak perfect <i>Bangla</i>, Mr Upadhyay!" The bald man's smile was warm. "I am Mrityunjoy Ghosh."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I knew his name of course. It just went to confirm my belief. Even then it caused me a strange disquiet. It was the same name that was written across the back of the photograph I had been sent by my client. I had burnt and flushed it down the toilet back in that hotel in Dharmatolla as a matter of course.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Bisheswar Upadhyay was enjoying his brief moment of attention. "Living in Calcutta for 40-odd years would do that to anyone..." He was attempting modesty.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Mrityunjoy Ghosh carried it further, "Anyone who is willing to lend an ear to the local language, Mr Upadhyay, and is willing to learn it."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I felt I had to join in somehow to maintain the facade of the usual journey-enforced friendliness among co-passengers. "Yes, definitely, Mr Upadhyay."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Thank you, thank you." He positively beamed. He turned towards the as-yet silent strident man who was still peering through the opaque window.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Er, Mr...," He waved a hand gently in front of that man's face though at a discreet distance. That man turned. "Yes?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, we were just getting familiar to pass the long hours in some pleasant conversations," he smoothly drew us in to his question.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I prefer quiet in mine," was the most rude response.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This threw me quite a bit. Seldom had I encountered a ruder person! His wife had heard the exchange and it appeared to me that she was embarrassed by this boorish behaviour. She answered, looking at Upadhyay directly, and her voice conveyed her apology.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Actually, we are going to Delhi. It has been a very tiring day..." She left it hanging, her voice trailing off very artfully for us to gather her intention of conveying her apology.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Her husband glared at her and then at each one of us. I thought I would have to put an end to this. As it is I was feeling irritated. The potential for an unnecessary squabble was thankfully defused with the arrival of the ticket examiner.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As we took our tickets out for him, Upadhyay stood up and peered into the chart in the ticket examiner's clipboard. Before the examiner could remark on that, Upadhyay offered his ticket to him. Soon his work was done, and he went further ahead. In his wake the deathless Ghosh took it upon himself to carry the conversation on.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Upadhyay, did you know..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I kept up a passing involvement in this general chitchat while the main thought in my mind was the insoluble mystery of this man who ate bullets alive.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Frankly, I have never been confronted by a conundrum so complete. The only persistent thought in my mind was of this man being shot and then living to sprint and catch the train. It just didn't gel. There had to be a logical explanation. My puzzle was to spot that. And I was failing in that repeatedly!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I determined to track it down before getting off the train at Kanpur. And then I thought of my other worry: My assignment was not complete! So, should I then make the attempt at fulfilling my commission on the train? I had very little time to plan. You see, I do meticulous planning for each and every job that I take. From travelling to the target's city—usually I do not undertake jobs in the same city I live in—tracking the target's daily routine, idiosyncrasies, local conditions, equipment to use—I do use guns mostly but sometimes a different tool is called for—and above all, my escape route.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">In this case, I was trapped in a railway carriage along with the target, for the next several hours. It would have to be in the night, as he slept. But that was too fluid a situation, quite to my complete dislike! Any noise could awaken someone else. As for escape, I could certainly time it such that I could immediately detrain after committing the act. But then that would crucify me as clearly as if I were confessing! There wouldn't be any room for suspicion, only for confirmation of guilt. And above every other consideration, these people had seen me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">What then was I to do?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">At this point my attention was fully drawn by a direct question posed by Upadhyay.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Dey, where do you stay in Kanpur?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">No worries, I do my homework. "Kidwainagar."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">His response took away my sense of self-satisfaction. "<i>Arre!</i> I am going there too! What a coincidence! How far or close to <i>Chaalis Dukaan</i>?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I didn't get that at all! What on earth was this moron blabbering about? I couldn't let my expression change though. "Er... not too far actually." What on earth was this whatever-<i>dukaan</i>?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"How nice! I am visiting my brother who stays in 'D' block. Maybe we can go there together from the station?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Seeing my expression probably he quickly added, "I mean, we could get to Kidwainagar together and then go our separate ways..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">At this crucial juncture my nemesis chimed in. "Er, Mr Upadhyay, what was that you said about some <i>dukaan</i>?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My ears perked up. Upadhyay was only too happy to explain.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"<i>Arre</i>, that's an area in Kidwainagar you know. A market really. It probably started with maybe forty shops and thus the name... <i>Chaalis Dukaan</i>. Who knows? But it certainly is a quaint name, eh, Mr Dey?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was now on surer ground. "Indeed! I have often wondered..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay then changed tacks. "What is your line of work, Mr Dey? Going by your appearance I must say you are in some technical field..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This is something I have good preparation for; in fact, I am prepared with several options, each configured for the situation I was in at that moment. I let loose my preferred one, "I am a freelance software consultant."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I am not surprised, Mr Dey!" Upadhyay's face was beaming. "I'm seldom mistaken in my judgment you know. My guess was that you are in some technical line. Don't ask me how I know. It is just that I can guess." He continued glowing gently in self-approbation.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Bravo, Mr Upadhyay!" The death-defying Mr Ghosh was quick to second that opinion. Then he turned to me, "My son is planning to take up computers, Mr Dey. Maybe I can take some advice from you on that? I am a complete novice in that regard." His manful admission was loathsome. But Upadhyay had to naturally commend him on that.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Well, Mr Ghosh," I said, "Certainly I can offer some advice. But you know, a lot would depend on what exactly your son specialises in." One of the usual ways to defuse a situation like this was for me to go into some degree of detail and that, in my experience, put most inquisitive people off.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Mr Ghosh appeared a bit flustered, damn the man. "Maybe you can give me your mobile number and I will have my son call you up to ask his questions?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Indeed! I almost choked. Then controlling myself, I said, "Sure, sure." I quickly decided that if this man survived the night and remembered to ask for my mobile number again, I would give it. No problem, since this was my "being normal" mobile whose number I could freely share. My business number was different, one that I hardly bandied about.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay, the indefatigable, next posed the same question of Mr Ghosh. My interest was drawn again despite well knowing his line of business.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I am a small businessman, Mr Upadhyay. Nothing big. I deal in electrical goods in the wholesale market." He adroitly turned the question around to Upadhyay himself. "What do you do?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>'Small businessman'</i>? My ears had caught those words. From what I recalled of my conversation with my latest client—who I had failed, at least till now—this Mr Ghosh had swindled my client out of a sizeable chunk of money which he had wanted to get back; having failed in that he was looking for revenge.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay was probably awaiting his moment. He smiled expansively. "I am a retired cloth merchant." He made it sound as if he was a retired diplomat of international repute! I mean when would you hear of a cloth merchant retiring? Pompous ass, I thought to myself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Did you know that Kanpur used to be a city of textiles? My brother and I were making excellent use of our mutual locations to run our business. He sourced cloth and I marketed it."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"From all appearances you did well for yourself, Mr Upadhyay," I remarked, rather drily I thought.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay's nature being what it was, he took that as a clear compliment, and thanked me quite graciously. And that man who had caused me such grievous agony, that Mr Ghosh, joined me in commending Upadhyay.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">At this juncture we seemed to be slowing down a bit, probably approaching Burdwan station.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Aah, Burdwan, I expect!" exclaimed Upadhyay.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You think they will serve dinner now?" Mr Ghosh was quite eager, it sounded to me, for food, blast that man!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, yes, Mr Ghosh. They should any moment now."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I hadn't noticed the strident man had dozed off with his head against the glass of the window. His wife now came forward and awakened him, speaking gently in Hindi.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Get up, <i>ji</i>. They'll serve dinner soon."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The man stirred and woke up with a scowl. What a man! I am sure any man with so beautiful a wife ought to be grateful and courteous. And way better behaved!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The strident man then stomped off, probably to the toilet. And his wife went back to her seat. The professorial lady had finally laid down her book and was rummaging about in a bag. Presently she took out a box, no doubt her home-cooked dinner. I laughed to myself for I can never fathom this peculiar desire some people have to eat their own usually gruesomely cooked food even when there is an alternative.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The train had halted. I squinted outside but could barely see anything. By the time the train started to roll again, the strident man was back and was enquiring of his wife if the food had been served. This kind of behaviour was causing me great irritation. Couldn't he <i>see</i> that it wasn't yet? It appeared that the couple was having a hushed argument. The professorial lady looked at them contemptuously and got on with her dinner. Upadhyay leaned forward and whispered to us:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"This man's name is Dr S. Kapila. I saw it in the TTE's chart, you know!" He winked as he said this. "Seems to me he has very high blood pressure, considering his irritability..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Mrityunjoy Ghosh agreed wholeheartedly. "Yes! I think you are right, Mr Upadhyay!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was spared from making any contribution to this needless gossip by the arrival of the pantry fellow with the trays stacked in his arms. I always marvel at the way they manage such large number of trays, orders, people... of whom quite a few were so petty and vindictive.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">While we were taking our trays, this newly-discovered Dr Kapila—how on earth could he be a doctor I wondered—brusquely ordered Ghosh off his seat.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You move to my seat, will you." It wasn't a question, you see. It was an order, flat in tone.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Something blew in my mind. "Who are you to order him off his seat?" My voice was raised, the tone quite aggressive; it had slipped out before I could stop myself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The immediate silence was rather complete. I realised everyone around me was gaping at me, the professorial lady with her mouth open. And Savita, that poor lady, was blushing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dr Kapila's face turned red. His stridency was pronounced. "Have you noticed my wife is across the aisle and we need to eat together? Do I need to ask your permission before requesting this gentleman to offer his seat temporarily so that we might have our dinner together?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was amazed at this appalling man! "Request? Gentleman? Is that your tone when you make a request?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">By this time, Upadhyay had gotten up, and between him and Ghosh, they tried to cool things down.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Dey! Let it be! I have already moved... forget it! Of course, they need to have their dinner together..." Ghosh was speaking urgently.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Suddenly, the strange situation hit me fully. Here I was, standing up for a man I had contracted to kill, and there he was, trying to cool <i>me</i> down! Little did he know how close to death he was—and how incredibly lucky to be still alive. The humour of the situation got me and I started laughing aloud.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This caused even more consternation. The professorial lady was beyond all comprehension. Upadhyay and Ghosh looked stupefied and the Kapila couple appeared completely nonplussed.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Okay, okay. No problem. Now that you have already moved, this matter is settled. Let's get on with our dinners..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">And laughing still, I dug into my rather appetising chicken-curry and rice.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I realised I had to come to a decision. Should I complete my assignment or should I accept this failure? My professional record had only two failures, both in the initial years of my career. For the last thirteen straight years I had had only successes. My reputation had been built on flawless executions. It had reached such a height that I was called away abroad for assignments at least once a year while I never did more than half a dozen jobs in a single year. There had never been any comebacks from any of my assignments. The general public did not know me; no one ever recalled having seen me while on a job. I was a faceless professional. And therein lay the biggest contributing factor for my success. Anonymity, coupled with skill and meticulous planning with flawless execution had made me what I am. Until this twit came along.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My dinner was almost over. The conversation was general, harmless; desultory. The Kapila couple was still at their dinner. The professorial lady, who had not uttered a word till now, was done and was back at her book, primly poised, with her body language signalling contempt for the people around her.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay belched contentedly. Ghosh was back after washing up and his last cigarette for the night possibly as well. I muttered an excuse-me and went off for my customary after-dinner smoke.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I opened one door, and then sitting in the attendant's folding seat, smoked a tense cigarette. Try as I might I was not coming up with a viable plan to complete my job. Making a hit is never really the main problem. I was hitting a dead end every time I tried to answer this question: What would I do <i>after</i>?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The wind rushing from the door swept away the curl of smoke that would otherwise be so comforting to watch. I felt my plans were behaving in the same manner, being swept away! I bent my mind to it again, with more determination than hope.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">What were my options?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Lure target to this place near the door and push him out? And claim it was an accident?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Smother him in his berth as he slept at night? And pretend complete ignorance on waking up?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Use my piano wire ring—a fancy tool that I had picked up in Sicily a few years back while vacationing there—to slice through the target's throat? (Would be very messy.) And claim ignorance? (this was the same as the previous one excepting for the method of despatch)</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Then I realised that I didn't really have too many options; only the methods could vary. Making a clean sweep of all my fellow passengers was technically an option but simply wasn't a serious contender; I had not been commissioned to do so. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It struck me that a supply of some delayed-reaction poison would have worked admirably. If I could administer it in the morning tea, this adamant fellow could be dead in half-a-day! I thought about that wistfully. But of course, I didn't have a ready supply of this poison. So then, back to square one!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Clashing with my professional pride was no less critical an aspect of my nature: prudence. I <i>never</i> take undue risks. One mistake can unravel all that I have built till now. This guiding principle has ensured I have never had to watch my back when I am not on a job.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A sudden thought struck me. In the minor excitement of finding that Upadhyay and I were both getting off at Kanpur, we had forgotten to ask where Ghosh was going. So, what if I did some artful enquiry of Ghosh to determine where and for how long was he going, I could easily follow him there and accomplish my task. This thought really perked me up. I <i>didn't</i> have to take a risk here in this confined situation. My dictum had paid off. <i>Think hard, think smart, and never lose focus on the essentials</i>.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Feeling much better—for after all, one has one's professional pride—I decided to go back and put my plan into action immediately. But delicately.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The other things in this maddening business were:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">How<i> did</i> this bullet defying half-pint survive? I had seen him     with own eyes just before I shot him! Where on earth was he now off     to—thoughtlessly massacring my peace of mind and pride—behaving so     blithely?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As I was getting up from the tiny seat, Savita walked out, probably to wash her hands. She smiled at me, and I cannot deny a thrill shot through me on seeing that perfect beauty in bloom. She dropped some debris into the bin and while washing her hands, said, "Mr Dey,"—she knew my name!—"I have to apologize for my husband's behaviour. Sometimes he just doesn't know what he is doing..." The clatter of the train ensured she had to raise her voice a little, else I am sure she would said this softly, matching the grace in her luminous eyes.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I hastened to assure her it was indeed a small matter and that I hadn't been offended in the least. A wild thought struck me. I have never commissioned my skills for my own self. But what if I did...? Despatched that abominable doctor and swept this beautiful woman off?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The intensity of the thought shook me! I was thinking like a carefree—and careless—teenager, for God's sake! I was a responsible adult, a man with a reputation to care about, and ought to act like one. Really!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Thank you for being a perfect gentleman, Mr Dey. I doubt if most people can be so caring and yet retain their balance."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Her compliment and the accompanying smile almost put paid to my tough act. A sense of embarrassment also prevented me from carrying on the conversation in this vein though I certainly wanted to make the most of this opportunity.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You said you were travelling to Delhi; do you live there?" I asked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, no. We are going there to attend my sister's wedding. We live in Calcutta, in Salt Lake, you know."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There were other people coming out now to wash up and the place had got a bit crowded, small as it was. She had finished, and just as we were to go in, her husband stalked out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"What are you taking so long for?" His voice sounded serrated. "I have been waiting for you, guarding the luggage from the thieving attendants and here you are, whiling away your time!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Savita was flustered. There were three or four other people crowded there and this was quite embarrassing. I thought swiftly: If I were to stand up for her she would probably have an even worse follow-up session with this boor. I kept quiet and went in without protest.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There were a few people who had already bunked down. But thankfully my co-passengers were still up and chatting.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay was naturally the person to welcome me back, again.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Dey! You keep going away for long periods!" His eyes shone with mirth. "So much smoking is not good for your health..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I smiled amiably—my intention was to pump the deathless Mr Ghosh for information.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Do you gentlemen intend to lie down right away?" I had to ascertain this in order to plan my next steps.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, no!" Upadhyay was quite categorical. "Let us chat for some time longer. We have been having a pretty interesting conversation, you know, Mr Dey."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"About what?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Nothing particular... The last topic was films. Mr Ghosh appears to a buff..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Ghosh the undying cleared his throat importantly. "I am a serious follower of Ray's films. Seen them all, y'know."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I am a minor fan of the great maestro Satyajit Ray myself though my usual taste in films ran to more <i>common</i> stuff, where I could lose myself for a couple of hours in a fantasy world, laughing without reason, with logic suspended.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was constantly looking out for the right opportunity to start on Ghosh while I participated in the casual chitchat. There were no intellectual pretensions from these two so consequently I did not have to really bend my mind to being subtle or sophisticated.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was yet to succeed in questioning the bullet-proof Ghosh when the strident Dr Kapila reappeared. Can you tell me how can a man be strident even when quiet? His wife was right behind. The good doctor then turned to us and said, "Which of you had berth 22?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I spotted the tense right away. "Had" instead of "has" which would have implied a notion of choice. This man did not believe in any scope for negotiation!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The unyielding Ghosh said in a mixed tone, "My berth is 22..." His voice trailed off uncertainly, yielding here pretty easily.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Was." His directness must have won him accolades in circles where being direct was considered just the thing. "I am sure even you have noticed that berth 22 now has stuff lying that doesn't belong to you?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">You simply had to hand it to this bruising stalwart. The bullet-digesting Ghosh was clearly stumped. Of course, there really cannot be any smart comeback to such a direct assault other than joining battle in the truest sense. And Ghosh did not appear to me to be of that sort; a rather peaceable bird.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Ghosh sat there in his seat, goggling. "I-I thought someone had just temporarily kept those pieces of luggage there... and would soon remove them!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Well, no. I have swapped that with the berth across the aisle, that one..." Dr Kapila pointed at the side upper berth. "My wife has taken this berth and you have that one. Any problem?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I wanted to really collar this oaf and plug his ears. Such breathtaking ability to sweep everyone else before his whims! I was itching to join battle.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As I should have expected by now, Savita stepped in. Voice modulated just to the right pitch, she spoke in honeyed tones, "Mr Ghosh,"—she knew his name too, dammit!—"will you please oblige me by changing your berth with mine? Side berths are... I mean, I am very uncomfortable with these berths..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Before Ghosh could be swept away by the request, the blasted Kapila burst. "Aren't I already speaking to this man?" His voice was so raised that a head peeked from the next compartment, curiosity animating the eyebrows considerably.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Savita was of course not going to react to this latest provocation; she kept quiet. But the job was done. Ghosh was almost falling over himself to oblige.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Not to worry, Mrs Kapila,"—he had let slip the name inadvertently—"not to worry, only too happy to oblige!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He had a silly smile on his face, wreathed in layers, that daft man! How I wished I could strangle him right away!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I will fit very well in that berth too, you know..." He looked at Upadhyay and me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay, being a man who is never short of a response, said, "But of course Mr Ghosh! You will fit very well there, and the lady will be safer inside this area..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had a sudden desire to offer my berth to Savita now. After all mine was a lower berth so it was likely she would prefer it...</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Why don't you take my berth, ma'am?" I was careful not to use her name.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That unmentionable Dr Kapila shoved his oar in. "She prefers an upper berth and therefore she'll take the one that Mr Ghosh has very kindly vacated!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This oscillation between perspectives was quite disorienting for me. One moment he addressed a person as if he were a slave at his command, the next moment the slave had not only attained freedom but had positively become a gentleman!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Savita, that fair creature, spoke softly, to me directly: "Thank you, Mr Dey. You are truly a gentleman... for offering your lower berth to me. But I will manage with the upper one, thank you so much!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Not manage, prefer!" said her husband savagely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">And thus ended the latest fracas. The professorial lady—whose name we discovered later to be Mrs U. Sehgal—had a very bleak expression. Nothing new in that of course.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The dratted doctor was not done yet. "Do you plan to sit around for longer? I want to get to bed."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Nothing stops you from doing that. Just ready yourself and go to bed!" I just could not take it any longer.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Surprisingly, this mad fellow did not quite pounce on me. "Just ensure the lights are off."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Without quite a plan in place firmly in my mind, I made a mental note of the changed berths. For after all if I did carry out the assignment in the course of the night, I would require to be unerring in my choice of berth! So now, in this changed scenario, Savita was in berth 22 and my target was on 24. In terms of ease of access there was no difference really. However, a side berth meant more possible eyeballs if things were to go wrong. And I have a very strong abhorrence of anything going wrong when I am on a job.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The mad doctor turned out to be a meticulous bed-maker. He started preparing the bunks, ensuring the bed sheet were neatly laid and tucked in at the sides, the pillow puffed up, the blankets laid out just so. In fact, it looked entirely out of character. Savita helped him of course.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Upadhyay was chatting placidly, not necessarily of anything specific or directed at someone precisely. I was frustrated by the lack of an opportunity in finding out from Ghosh his destination. Since whatever was being discussed seemed so removed from this matter that I couldn't quite slide it in edgewise.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There was a lull in the conversation when the demented doctor stepped between us to lay the sheet out on Savita's new berth. Upadhyay murmured an "excuse me" and adding, "I will be back from the toilet before bedding down", went on his way. Ghosh was alone for a few minutes!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I decided to be direct. "Mr Ghosh, what is your destination? I quite forgot to ask you earlier..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The death-mocker was only too glad to update me! "New Delhi for half a day and then am on my way to Singapore to attend an electrical goods exposition there."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Hell! Before I could assimilate this news, he went on, blithely as usual, throwing my needs to the winds, "Actually my half day in Delhi is also for the annual electrical goods exposition now on at the Pragati Maidan there. I would have stayed there longer, at least another two days but the Singapore one has unfortunately coincided and that will be on for another two days exactly. And that covers a much larger gathering, more companies participate, more new products, altogether more exciting and interesting! But the Delhi one is essential since my local suppliers will be there..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Oh, I see!" was all that I could manage. Thankfully Savita stepped between us to do something with her berth, while her wild husband stood beside, scowling fiercely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Bloody hell, I said to myself again. The kind of programme Ghosh had outlined for himself, without any consideration to be sure, completely did away with any chance for me to catch up with him there in Delhi! I had to detrain at Kanpur and then I was to catch another to my next hop before making it to my final destination. Even if I dumped everything and followed Ghosh to Delhi directly I doubted if I could simply knock him off just anywhere! An assassination is not a simple murder, for God's sake!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The Kapilas had moved away, Savita going off towards the exit, presumably to the toilet before retiring for the night. The crazy doctor lingered, scowling. Upadhyay meanwhile returned and started readying his bunk in turn. The remorseless Ghosh had started work on his as well. Only the hawkish lady across the aisle and I remained unready for bed, and my mind was a seething turmoil.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was back to square one with a murderous thump. The plain unfairness of the situation was now galling. I had made a fair and square hit, watched the body dropping and yet the target was right here, walking, talking, quite living it up, with every intention of flying hither and thither, fulfilling every whim! At that moment I knew, simply knew, that I had to get him. Else I would lose my self-esteem. And would then run the danger of having to hang up my gloves, having to fall back upon my savings to live the rest of my not inconsiderable number of years ahead.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I completed the task of readying to retire for the night without realising it and went off for a final smoke. I desperately needed to think. Think alone. So I headed for the tiny toilet.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The constant rattling in the toilet was most distracting but I persevered, leaning against the wall. The stink did nothing to alleviate that distraction of course. I tried to align my thoughts once more:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Was my mind made up on completing the assignment, this blot on my career? Yes, a resounding yes!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Would it help if I pursued the bullet-dodger Ghosh to Delhi, hoping to do my job there? Not too bright a chance of that really. Too short a time. What had this strange survivor said? He would be there in Delhi for only half a day. So there.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       What was left then? Here, in the train, was my only possible opportunity. <i>Now,</i> <i>I can only wonder how stultified my thinking had become by then!</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">So then? Nothing to it, I said to myself. In the middle of the night, possibly around 2 or 3 am, when most passengers would be more likely to sleep, I would do it. I knew there was a possible window of opportunity for about ninety minutes between the stations of Koderma and Gaya Junction that I could use. <i>Even this did not ring a bell! Goes perhaps to show how really rattled I was at that stage, how warped my thinking.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I bent my mind to selecting the tool I would use. I preferred a gun of course but in this situation, that was surely unsuitable. The piano wire was also not quite the thing. I would then use the stiletto that I had in my valise. That would best serve the purpose. Expertly wielded, the person at the receiving end would barely realise something was amiss. There would be blood for sure but well, you couldn't make an omelette without breaking eggs, could you?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Once the job was done I would just step back to my berth and try to sleep; most certainly I would feign sleep till it was light. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Making my mind up made me feel a mite better. So now I had a plan, well, a sort of plan, that comprised a time window for the job, equipment to use, and the critical part of any such plan, what would I do next.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I looked at my watch and found that almost thirty minutes had passed. I thought of heading back again, and begin my mental preparation for my job. I stepped out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Outside a very cross looking man gave me a disgusted stare and almost pushed past me into the toilet I vacated. He had apparently been waiting for quite some time. But then why had he not tried the other one? That must also be occupied, and he cast malignant looks at the first person who came out. I smiled to myself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Quite a variety of snores assailed my ears as I made my way down to my compartment. What a cacophony!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The professorial lady was now primly lying down, the curtain not yet drawn as the death-defying Ghosh was just climbing on to the upper berth above her. I smiled at him, civil to the last! The curtains were drawn on my compartment. Inside, I found Upadhyay lying down but reading a magazine using his reading lamp. I returned his smile as well. I could not avoid stealing a glance at Savita but she was well covered under the blanket; not to blame her since it had become pretty cool. Probably asleep already I told myself. Anyway, from my berth I could keep an eye on her, breaking into a rather adolescent mental smile. Her husband was in the berth above mine and he appeared to be reading some journal, frown in place no doubt!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There were two immediate minor problems to resolve. One was to take my stiletto out without anyone glimpsing it and the other was to set an alarm for 1:30AM... now hold! I told myself. An alarm would make noise and I couldn't risk anyone else waking up due to that at that odd hour! Scratch the alarm then. I squatted on my haunches, drawing the valise out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"What Mr Dey, you will read now?" I was almost startled. It was Upadhyay of course.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Eh? Yes, yes... just taking something out for that purpose..." Thankfully I did have a book in there that I could pretend to take out while I manoeuvred the stiletto out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Never lacking in the milk of human kindness sloshing inside him, Upadhyay continued. "If you like you could read this book I have here with me. Here, take this..." He thrust a book forward, blast his good-natured soul!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I took it but responded, "Thank you Mr Upadhyay, but I want to finish my book. It is almost at the end, at a very interesting point, you see..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Of course, of course," Upadhyay agreed. He seemed to be in a chatty mood again; indeed, when wasn't he? "I am feeling sorry for Mr Ghosh. After you and I are alight at Kanpur he will not have much company, really."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I heard a grunt from the berth above mine. That oaf was probably feeling slighted by Upadhyay's comment. Serves him right! I decided to twist that a bit further.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, I agree, Mr Upadhyay. Maybe he will have to read some books or magazines to keep himself occupied..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, another about 8 hours after Kanpur..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was while that mad doctor's irritated comment on this when <i>it struck me</i>!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"People need to sleep. Shut up, will you?" I couldn't see him but could well imagine his expression. Upadhyay, who could see him, looked a bit startled, and started to make some conciliatory gesture. But I was thinking...</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">We were to get off at Kanpur around twenty minutes past 12. Another eight hours would mean... 8:30PM at least! <i>Why hadn't this occurred to me in the toilet when I was trying to make my plan? For of course Ghosh could not be going for the exposition at night! He would need to stay somewhere for the night, attend the exposition the following day before flying out to Singapore some time later in the evening! Contrary to what I was thinking, I did have a whole night in Delhi when I could do the job!</i> Bloody hell!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As I lay on my berth, I was thinking feverishly. Should I then drop my current plan and postpone everything for Delhi? I would have to abandon my planned journey schedule, skip my connecting train from Kanpur and take another instead for Delhi immediately. I would also need to get the dratted Ghosh's address in Delhi, and that too without Upadhyay's knowledge since that fellow knew me to be dropping off at Kanpur altogether.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I groaned inwardly as I realised that Upadhyay was also expecting me to travel with him till Kidwainagar before I could make good my escape from his friendly clutches, haring back to the station to board my next train, which I could jolly well miss if there were any timing glitches.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The clash of the various variables, the moving pieces in this increasingly complex situation, was pushing me more and more towards persisting with my current plan of disposing of the deathless Ghosh here and now. That way, there would be next to no disruption of my plans. Of course, there would be a fair amount of ruckus on the discovery of Ghosh's death. But I was sure I could get away with some convincing act in front of the passengers and the police. I did not consider this factor to be too difficult. They could hardly start searching every passenger's luggage, though that measure, if resorted to, could prove to be rather difficult to cope with. I would of course dispose of the stiletto, dropping it through the toilet hole, but what about the rifle tucked away in my valise? For sure I was not going to drop that off too! I had designed it myself, built on a Dragunov SVD frame, trimmed of all fat, with a light graphite stock and slim butt, and simple bolt action. It carried no magazine—since I don't believe you can be in this business if you cannot do the job within the first two bullets, and you would barely have time beyond one single reload in case the first one missed or didn't do the job—and mounted a venerable Schmidt &amp; Bender 1985 model scope that accounted for parallax, bullet drop compensation, the works. I couldn't throw them away, could I?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Reviewing every aspect just confirmed in my mind that I ought to do the job now. The associated risks could be handled. Delaying would not necessarily ease the problem. I was convinced. All that now remained for me to do before dropping off for a couple of hours of refreshing sleep was to take my stiletto out. Or, why not do that at that time as well? I could not see any problem with that either.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I must tell you that I have this ability to tell myself to wake up at a certain hour upon need. It is like an internal alarm clock that I needed to activate when required and I would be awake for sure, give or take five minutes from that appointed hour. The intervening hours would be dreamless slumber.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The grumbling Kapila was quiet. Upadhyay had also just switched off his reading lamp, thankfully refraining from making any further conversation. Which looked to me the only positive contribution made by that mad doctor in the scheme of things!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I think I was asleep in the next ten minutes, having set my internal clock for a 1:30AM wake-up call.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I prefer to think it was my internal clock that woke me up rather than that tremendous drilling noise that assaulted my ears immediately upon waking. I soon realised it was actually real, giant-sized snoring that had sounded to me like a pack-drill in action. Nothing irritates me more than being woken up by something infernal like that. It was utterly dark, there was no night lamp on but as my senses sharpened, I identified that din as emanating from my immediate left: Upadhyay! Why, that so-and so! I exclaimed to myself. Then it struck me that this could be a good cover in case I made some minor noise. I checked the time; it was indeed 1:35AM, the train stationary. It appeared vaguely there was some platform outside: Koderma, I thought.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I waited silently, listening, listening. And could detect no other movement or noise, other than this massive, raucous snoring. At that moment, there was some slight jerk above me; the mad doctor turning over I realised.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I took my valise out silently. The catches didn't make any noise either. Soon the stiletto was in my hand. Nothing had moved or changed. I palmed it, turning it up, tucking it along my wrist, and swung back silently on my berth, sitting. I waited, observing, alert to the slightest change in the environment.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">All was quiet—if you could call things quiet with Upadhyay going full blast. I looked at Savita's covered form. She didn't appear to have moved at all since I last saw her. I couldn't see the now-not-strident Kapila above me, but I could sense the presence. I didn't have to look at Upadhyay; his audio output announced his presence most vehemently. I parted the curtains on our side to keep an eye across the aisle, where the curtains were drawn; there were no ripple of movement there. I wondered how anyone could possibly sleep in this racket but then even I had slept through some of it until I was woken by my internal system clock.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I usually nerve myself before such a job, particularly when using a more personal tool like the stiletto. The mind has to be free of all clutter, alert to handle any eventuality, circumvent a sudden—and heaven forbid unforeseen— circumstance.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I mapped the steps out in my mind:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Move the curtains apart just enough for me to have access</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Spot the exact point to insert the knife—my target being between the fourth and fifth ribs on the left side (I had marked that Ghosh had laid down such that his left side faced outside; one stroke of luck for me, finally)</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Slide the knife in through the designated spot, holding the mouth tight</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Slide it out</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Wipe it clean, both blade and handle</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Go quickly to the toilet and drop the knife through the hole</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       Step back smartly to my berth</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">-       And lie down, hopefully without anyone the wiser</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">After the train restarted, I waited a further ten minutes, sitting quietly, not moving at all. Then, with a final breath to calm my nerves, I rose, the knife still poised the way I had been holding all this while: tucked along the inside of my wrist in my right hand. The Velcro fastener made a slight ripping noise as I moved the curtain apart at the middle. I let a few seconds pass as I accustomed my eyes to the dimmer space inside.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Ghosh was lying straight up, blanket drawn over fully. There was a vague murmur of a gentle snore, no more than a whisper: a gentlemanly snorer, I thought. Without further ado, I lifted the blanket as it appeared appropriate to me and could make out the form underneath as a vague and darker shadow. I made a swift estimate. I mentally marked the target spot accurately. Transferring the knife in my hand such that it was now pointing forward from my fist, I clamped my palm down hard on the target's mouth. It is precisely for situations like these that I have practised with steel spring grips such that my hold is like a vise.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Before this bullet defying Ghosh could cry out, I slid the knife in smoothly through the exact point I had identified.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Blood gushed out from that point, and the target stiffened, thrashing very slightly, his mouth straining under my clamped palm but to no avail. In a couple of seconds, he lay quiet, probably the moment the stiletto bit into his heart.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I slid the knife out and bunched the bed sheet and blanket as best as I could to stanch the blood flow. I wiped the knife on the body and that is when the light shone on me brightly, harshly.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The light from the electric torch was really harsh. It lit up the scene as if with a searchlight, shining upon a short man in indeterminate dark trousers, a white shirt that appeared to have a dark splotch on the front. He had turned around involuntarily when the light shone on him and in that even his chin appeared to be flecked with black ink drops. His eyes were screwed shut, left arm raised protectively against that light. And in his right fist appeared a long, thin knife that appeared to have some dark splotches as well.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The man with the torch had started to scream loudly: screeching, unintelligible cries that were blood-curdling but incoherent in terror.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Ghosh, Mr Ghosh, what happened, what happened?" Upadhyay had risen in a rush, quite disoriented, but shoving off his blanket. Savita had woken up too and was climbing down from her berth.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">From across Savita's berth, Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh was stuttering, incoherent and disjointed, "Loo-loo-look at-t-t-t th-th-is ma-ma-m..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">By this time Upadhyay had gathered his wits considerably. "Mr Dey! What're you doing with that knife in your hand?" His pitch was high, clearly high-strung. Meanwhile, there were other people from the compartments around that had woken, gathering but quite inchoate, totally confused. Savita, also down now, reached back and switched the main lights on.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">In that light—the torch still on—Rathin Dey still stood, looking stupidly at the knife in his hand. As Ghosh came down and stood beside Upadhyay, Dey looked up at Ghosh. At once a terrible change in expression occurred across his face. It visibly collapsed.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Y-you", he whispered, audible in the deathly quiet that had descended now. He could not take his eyes off Ghosh's face, mesmerised, terrified. "Y-you are a ghost... I have killed you twice now..." The words were uttered in a toneless voice, just above a whisper, disbelief the chief emotion discernible in that.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There was a gradual background hum building up, but Savita's voice was clear, above it. Calm in its deadly syllables. "You've killed my husband, you murderer!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Clearly, Dey was in no frame of mind to handle this. His look was of complete bewilderment, but realising who it was speaking, he turned towards Savita but could not meet her eyes; he dropped to his knees, his knife clattering on the floor. Behind him, the lady passenger, Mrs U. Sehgal, had risen, but one glance at the now visible constant drip of blood from the berth above her and the scene in front, she fainted wordlessly.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I looked at this pitiable man sitting across my desk, my mind quite churning with questions, bafflement and disgust, each in equal measure possibly. This despicable, so-called assassin—in my words, a hit-man, a killer for hire and nothing so romantic as an "assassin"—had been speaking steadily for more than two hours, confessing to his entire career worth of assassinations. But the very way he had been speaking, his asides in his confession—sprinkled pretty generously right through—told me that he was still entirely bewildered with the turn of events. Once he had taken a toilet break—permitted with a couple of armed policemen pointing guns from either side as he went about his business, reportedly in a daze—during which time I had called up various authorities. Of course, I had let the train depart after the pandemonium had reduced a tad, but delayed by several hours naturally.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had to detain several passengers of course, who I simply had to question and get statements from. But they had done so quite willingly, one of them even missing some important business travel plans. Indeed, that man was the pivot of the whole story: Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh. The others were this assassin's co-passengers, Mr Bisheswar Upadhyay, and Mrs Savita Kapila, wife of the deceased. There was another passenger in their compartment, Mrs U. Sehgal who had recorded her statement but refused point-blank to stay back for further questioning. She gave me her contact details. In any case she was quite hopeless as a witness as she had seen nothing before the event and nor after, when she had just fainted. The dead body was off-loaded as well. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Now I was waiting for the local police SHO to take over from me. Within sight of my retirement in my service with the Railway police, I could do without the unnecessary excitement; that was my sentiment. Though of course, a lifetime spent dealing with crime had given me the idea this was one of the most unusual cases I had come across.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Initial statements from the various people who I had questioned led me to believe this was a murder provoked by earlier quarrels. There were reportedly at least two quarrels between the deceased and the alleged murderer directly, but neither in my opinion was cause enough to commit murder; but then if you have been around in the police for the number of years I have been, you will know there are murders committed for far less provocation. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">One witness had mentioned the "surreptitious" chat the alleged murdered had had with the deceased's wife, Savita Kapila, near the toilet area on the train during the journey. This witness recorded his statement where he mentioned he had personally witnessed this scene, which was immediately followed by the deceased "walking in unannounced and cursing his wife". That was an angle I was looking to go into but when the so-called assassin started his confession all such thoughts fled from my mind.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Inspector Pandey, do you have any idea what anguish this has caused me?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I looked up at him. Despite having been at the receiving end of this man's candour, he still retained the capacity to astound me. "Anguish? I am not sure I understand you, Mr Dey!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Early on in the interrogation I had realised this man was a curious creature that comprised some old-world formality, strange charm of manner, passable wit and complete docility—at least the last certainly in this situation he was in. "I am an honourable man, Inspector Pandey", he had offered self-righteously. I saw no harm in maintaining a facade of gentlemanly urbaneness. Indeed, this man appeared to respond favourably to that.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes! Professional pride! The anguish of having your professional pride torn from you!" His face was animated, voice breathless, eyes wide. "In my entire career I have never had to fail so ignominiously, Inspector!" He broke off, looking off at the breaking dawn outside my office window. "I killed that man twice and yet both times he lived!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">When he had started, this so-called assassin who called himself Rathin Dey, he was incoherent, visibly emotionally disturbed. In fact, so disturbed that he had made no attempt at escape nor given any alibi or offered some cooked-up reason for being caught literally red-handed. He confessed right away, the under-current I thought throughout being his almost primeval desire to understand why what had happened that had happened!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had figured out the reasons behind the seeming mystery during the confession of course and had confirmed my doubts making those phone calls. But I will be getting ahead of myself if I were to launch upon my interpretations right away. Instead, let me offer the summary of the notes I had made of the statements of the three prime witnesses, the chief being the twice-blessed and twice-born Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><b>Mrityunjoy Ghosh</b>: I think it was maybe 12:30 in the middle of the night that Dr Kapila woke me up.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Ghosh, wake up."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I woke up with a start. I am light sleeper so it was not really difficult to do so. "What happened? Mr Kapila...?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Not mister! It is Doctor and you better remember!" I thought it very rude of him to wake me up and instruct me on top of that. Maybe I was a bit rude myself next.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Okay, Dr Kapila. Fine? Now tell me!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You will need to go to my berth. Now." Just like that! So sudden and so peremptory that I was quite breathless.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"But you asked me to come to this berth yourself!" You will remember Inspector it was Dr Kapila himself who had almost ordered me off my own berth earlier in the evening.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Doesn't matter! That man... that Upadhyay snores like a goddamn pig! I cannot sleep in that! So, you will go there, and I will switch here."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The injustice did not escape me of course. "I am a light sleeper myself, Dr Kapila! I am afraid I will not be able to accept your request."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Listen buster,"—yes, he actually said that, I assure you, Inspector!—"that was your berth, or okay, adjacent to your berth. Basically, the same thing! Had I not requested you to change you would have been living through that hell yourself anyway!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I am a peaceable man, Inspector. I hate quarrels, disturbances, all kinds of slanging matches. The very reason why I had stepped into the quarrel between Mr Dey and Dr Kapila earlier. So without much more ado I moved to the berth above Mr Dey's, who slept right through that without any sign of being disturbed. Dr Kapila also shifted right away—without thanking me of course—and probably fell asleep promptly for I heard no more from him. What a man!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I tossed and turned for quite a long time actually, probably just before the train reached Koderma. It was possibly sometime then that I drifted off. But it must have been only for a short while when I was awakened by some thudding noise. I sensed it coming from across the aisle. I found the curtains already pulled apart and so shone my torch. The sight that struck me chilled me to my bones! Mr Dey was standing before my earlier berth where Dr Kapila now was sleeping, and he appeared to be holding some kind of dagger in his fist! The moment the light struck him he had turned, and I could see the dark blotch on his shirt—which turned out to be blood when the overhead light was switched on—and his expression was completely demented! I shouted and shouted... until Mr Upadhyay woke up.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><b>Bisheswar Upadhyay</b>: Yes, Inspector Pandey, yes, I do snore a bit. My wife complains bitterly all the time, but you know, there are some things that one cannot help. And this is one of them. After witnessing that rather ugly quarrel between Mr Dey and Dr Kapila just before they went to bed I guess I must have read only for a short period. I slept thereafter and know nothing of any intervening incident. This switching back of berths between Mr Ghosh and Dr Kapila is something that I have no clue about.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The next thing I do know about is Mr Ghosh shrieking at the top of his voice. Incoherent and demented it seemed to me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Ghosh, Mr Ghosh, what happened?" I understand now that even I was shouting but I guess that was more in sympathy than due to any other reason.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">By the time I had got down from my berth I noticed Mrs Kapila had also awakened and was getting down herself. She switched on the light immediately after, but I had already glimpsed the scene as revealed by Mr Ghosh's torchlight. The sight froze my blood!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">There was blood dripping rapidly down from the upper berth across the aisle, the one I now understand Dr Kapila was on. And that nice Mr Dey with a long knife in his hand, looking quite mad! In a moment I realised what had happened: Mr Dey was provoked beyond words and had killed that very rude Dr Kapila while he slept.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><b>Savita Kapila</b>: That man is a loathsome murderer! Inspector, I can never forgive him, he has ruined my life! He has to be hanged. Only then would this place be a bit safer!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Eh, Inspector? Alright, okay, I will just tell you what happened and refrain from making any comments otherwise.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This... Mr Dey had picked quarrels twice in course of the short journey, just imagine! And he had also accosted me out in the coach foyer, forcing a conversation upon me. My husband is... was a possessive but very loving soul, Inspector. He disliked some other man talking to me in that furtive manner. And being a gentleman, he scolded me rather than him who was actually at fault.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Anyway, just before we turned in for the night he requested that nice Mr Ghosh to swap berths with me which he did being the gentleman he is. But later, my dear husband was much disturbed by Mr Upadhyay's rather loud snoring and he woke me up. It was I who suggested to him that he swap his berth back with Mr Ghosh, who I was sure would commiserate with his misery. Little did I know I was sending him to his death!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>(Resumed after a break of about 10 minutes when Mrs Kapila composed herself after breaking down, poor thing.)</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I fell asleep almost immediately and awoke only when I heard that fiendish howling that I later identified as Mr Ghosh shouting.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I switched the light on and the scene filled me with dread! I saw Mr Dey standing there, dementedly staring at the bloody knife in his fist. And the blood that was literally flowing from my husband's berth told me what had happened: this mad brute had murdered my husband out of jealousy, hatred, and the hope of getting me. Yes, Inspector, a woman knows such things very well!</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">So there you are: The three main witnesses and their statements. Of course, each has its own perspective. Mrs Kapila's seemed a bit garnished to me but maybe her perspective would be coloured insofar as any dutiful wife's would be. While Mr Ghosh and Mr Upadhyay had mentioned the cause of the quarrels as more provoked by Dr Kapila's rather rude personality—indeed, their own experience with the plainly curiously behaved Dr Kapila was in-line with that—his wife had tended to gloss over that aspect. Understandably, I say.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My reverie was broken by Dey's plaintive question, "Inspector, what could be the reason for my double failure? My reputation—not that it matters now—is in tatters. At least if I can know the reasons I can cope with them. Can you help?" His expression was earnest, without guile.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had already decided to tell this killer for hire my deductions that I thought were pretty accurate. I said, "Actually the reasons are simple, very simple.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Let me begin by setting up the parameters. Tell me Mr Dey, when did you reach the site where you shot the supposed Mr Ghosh?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Supposed...?" His bewilderment was pronounced. I had to ask the question again, channelling him.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I reached the site around 4:00PM that afternoon..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Very well. Meaning, you had not been there before that."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, no! I had followed Mr Ghosh to his office that morning, but then had gone off since I had decided to make the hit only later that day and there was no point in hanging around the site unnecessarily, increasing the risk. I had established earlier that Mr Ghosh almost never went anywhere else in the course of the day and did his business mostly from his office, receiving many visitors there."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Exactly," I said. "You had gone away believing Mr Ghosh would stay put the whole day until you did your deed."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You mean he had left earlier that day?" Dey was whispering. "But..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I interrupted him. "Be that as it may." I cannot deny I was enjoying this armchair deduction.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Tell me now what you did after you went there at 4:00PM."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dey was talking almost to himself now. "I climbed upstairs, on to the roof. The entire building was almost empty. I met no one as I went up. On the roof, I set up my vigil at the spot I had predetermined, screened from the door on the roof by a couple of half-finished columns. From there I commanded Ghosh's entire office-front. I assembled my gun, and calibrated the scope using the peon's head, until I could see each individual hair... then I waited, keeping an eye both on the watch and on Ghosh's stepping out for his smoke..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"As you told me, you were sighting your rifle through the openings in the railing, right?" I asked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, yes, that's what I did." He was a bit impatient.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"And you were keeping your vigil through the scope, right?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, yes! I have already told you all these! Why are you repeating them?" Now he was quite annoyed. Annoyed, I ask you!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>(Resumed after a break of about 10 minutes when Mrs Kapila composed herself after breaking down, poor thing.)</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I fell asleep almost immediately and awoke only when I heard that fiendish howling that I later identified as Mr Ghosh shouting.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I switched the light on and the scene filled me with dread! I saw Mr Dey standing there, dementedly staring at the bloody knife in his fist. And the blood that was literally flowing from my husband's berth told me what had happened: this mad brute had murdered my husband out of jealousy, hatred, and the hope of getting me. Yes, Inspector, a woman knows such things very well!</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">So there you are: The three main witnesses and their statements. Of course, each has its own perspective. Mrs Kapila's seemed a bit garnished to me but maybe her perspective would be coloured insofar as any dutiful wife's would be. While Mr Ghosh and Mr Upadhyay had mentioned the cause of the quarrels as more provoked by Dr Kapila's rather rude personality—indeed, their own experience with the plainly curiously behaved Dr Kapila was in-line with that—his wife had tended to gloss over that aspect. Understandably, I say.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My reverie was broken by Dey's plaintive question, "Inspector, what could be the reason for my double failure? My reputation—not that it matters now—is in tatters. At least if I can know the reasons I can cope with them. Can you help?" His expression was earnest, without guile.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had already decided to tell this killer for hire my deductions that I thought were pretty accurate. I said, "Actually the reasons are simple, very simple.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Let me begin by setting up the parameters. Tell me Mr Dey, when did you reach the site where you shot the supposed Mr Ghosh?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Supposed...?" His bewilderment was pronounced. I had to ask the question again, channelling him.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I reached the site around 4:00PM that afternoon..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Very well. Meaning, you had not been there before that."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, no! I had followed Mr Ghosh to his office that morning, but then had gone off since I had decided to make the hit only later that day and there was no point in hanging around the site unnecessarily, increasing the risk. I had established earlier that Mr Ghosh almost never went anywhere else in the course of the day and did his business mostly from his office, receiving many visitors there."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Exactly," I said. "You had gone away believing Mr Ghosh would stay put the whole day until you did your deed."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You mean he had left earlier that day?" Dey was whispering. "But..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I interrupted him. "Be that as it may." I cannot deny I was enjoying this armchair deduction.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Tell me now what you did after you went there at 4:00PM."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dey was talking almost to himself now. "I climbed upstairs, on to the roof. The entire building was almost empty. I met no one as I went up. On the roof, I set up my vigil at the spot I had predetermined, screened from the door on the roof by a couple of half-finished columns. From there I commanded Ghosh's entire office-front. I assembled my gun, and calibrated the scope using the peon's head, until I could see each individual hair... then I waited, keeping an eye both on the watch and on Ghosh's stepping out for his smoke..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"As you told me, you were sighting your rifle through the openings in the railing, right?" I asked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, yes, that's what I did." He was a bit impatient.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"And you were keeping your vigil through the scope, right?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, yes! I have already told you all these! Why are you repeating them?" Now he was quite annoyed. Annoyed, I ask you!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"That's where you made your fundamental mistake, Mr Dey."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mistake? You dare call that a mistake? Do you know how many years I have been doing this?" Dey thundered at me, probably raising his voice for the first time. Aah, stung professional pride. Again.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was compelled to show some steel. "Shut up, Mr Dey. I am treating this as an intellectual exercise for the moment, precisely until the local police shows up. Then you will be gone. Forever. You get that?" I leaned forward on the desk.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dey quietened, yes, but his curiosity being much aroused, he didn't react to this. "I am not concerned about that, Inspector. Go ahead, ask your questions."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I will come back to that. For the moment, tell me if you know the name of your client?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes. I do. His name is Natabar Das."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"And you know who this is, of course."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"But of course! He is Ghosh's ex-partner. They parted some time back on very ugly terms. That's what Das told me when commissioning me. He had started to explain his reason but I stopped him. These things don't concern me, I told him. I accept a commission and act upon it. The reasons behind such a job mean nothing to me. I also told him that if Ghosh had contacted me instead to decommission"—yes, that is the term this extraordinary hit-man used—"Das I would have done it equally competently..." He broke off here, only to continue a second later.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"That is the word I used, Inspector Pandey! 'Competently'! And look at me! I have made the most complete hash of it!" He shook himself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I sipped my glass of tea that the <i>hawaldar</i> had placed before us. "Allow me to give you a brief background, Mr Dey."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Natabar Das had embezzled close to a crore of rupees about three years back from their joint business. That was the reason why they parted, and Ghosh also got Das to sign some legal papers giving up all claims on the business. However, on the pleadings of Natabar Das's wife, Ghosh refrained from pressing further charges and for punitive damages.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Six months ago, Mrs Das passed away and along with her went away all reasons for restraint on Das's desire for revenge.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Das must have been looking for some way to hit back. And somehow, he came across your services"—I almost asked him if Dey advertised for his services—"and contacted you. And you took the 'commission'.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Some of what I am telling you is obviously logical jumps I am making on reasonable assumptions and deductions, you understand, Mr Dey." Dey nodded dumbly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"So, you did your surveillance, noted Mr Ghosh's usual routine. But since you didn't know of his immediate plans—what with Das out of bounds from that—you did not know of his travel plans.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Mr Ghosh left his office yesterday before noon. He went home, did some last-minute shopping and left early along with his luggage for a client meeting that otherwise would have happened at his own office. He left for the station directly from that meeting. In his hurry, he also forgot completely to charge his mobile. By the time he boarded the train it was totally discharged.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"That is where you came face to face with the man who you thought you had already 'decommissioned'".</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dey's expression was sagging by now. But his tenuous link with reality was still persisting.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Hold on, Inspector! You're forgetting I had seen Ghosh with my own eyes... through the scope!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I smiled. "I remember that perfectly, Mr Dey. But what you're forgetting instead is that <i>when you see through the scope set at high magnification, you only see a very limited view of the object you are sighting. Here you were only seeing the crown of a bald head</i>."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">You could see the truth slowly dawning on Dey now. He was crumpling before my eyes.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Y-you mean..." he whispered.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I changed tack again. Keep this killer unsettled. "Do you know what Das looks like?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Dey shook his head, uncertainty struggling with the pressure of dawning truth. "No, no I don't know that at all." His voice was hardly above a whisper.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I gave it to him without compunction. "Natabar Das was a bald man. Also."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A long sigh escaped Dey, his face ashen. His tea sat untouched before him. His expression was that of a stricken man.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I covered the pending ground quickly now. "Natabar had come visiting that afternoon to Mr Ghosh's office, pretending to seek a meeting to ending their quarrel, rekindling a social relationship, perhaps? Or maybe he had come to gloat over his nemesis' death? See him one last time? I don't know... surely, he couldn't have known of your plan...</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Maybe that's something we'll never know. But he did visit that afternoon and waited for almost two hours, despite Mr Ghosh's staff telling him Mr Ghosh was off to Delhi and then to Singapore. Perhaps Das thought the staff had been instructed to mislead Das deliberately. Who knows?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I think his patience was running out. He had tried calling Mr Ghosh's mobile several times from the office, but his mobile was switched off, which is exactly what the recorded message says when your mobile has run out of battery, as Mr Ghosh's had. Which he had tried charging on the train, but something was wrong with the power outlet and it did not charge.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Natabar stepped out, and lit a cigarette. And you, Mr Dey, perched on that roof, sighting through that scope alone, saw only a bald head of a man who had stepped out at approximately the same time. And you thus shot your own client.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Strange justice, eh?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My tea was finished, and my mouth was dry. This killer for hire was a completely shattered man, his confidence destroyed, and his life surely destined to be terminated sometime soon in the future.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Just then, there was some commotion outside. My <i>hawaldar</i> came running to inform that Inspector Khan from the local police had finally arrived to take the killer into custody. As I rose to greet Khan, I noticed this strangely gentlemanly killer square his shoulders, as if he had finally come to terms with the hitherto impregnable mystery of the twice-blessed, death defying Mrityunjoy Ghosh.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>My hands are shackled. Like that of a common criminal. Where is my pride? My professional pride? The kindly Inspector Pandey had permitted me to finish my cold tea. I am walking down the corridor leading possibly to the jeep, waiting to transport me to a life I now cared nothing about.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>Who is that? My eyes seem to be bleary, the images blurred. I can see it is a woman, followed by a bald man. Who are they?</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>A few steps closer, I see it is Savita. She is radiant in her black sari. The bald man behind looks like Ghosh, the invincible. I am not sure though.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>Savita steps forward and says something to this new tall inspector. I cannot hear what. He nods his head and she comes closer to me. Ghosh is farther off, standing, waiting. Beyond, I can now also see Upadhyay. Perhaps my vision is clearing?</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>"You despicable murderer!" Her voice is so sweet. The words don't resonate to me. I don't know their meaning.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>She comes closer. Now only I am in front of her. There is no one behind me. Does she hate me? Will she kill me? The inconsequential thoughts flash through my mind. I am unconcerned. She comes closer still. Now I can see she is smiling. Oh, so enchanting her smile! She comes even closer. I can reach out and touch her.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large"><i>She whispers. I can hear her. "Thank you, Mr Dey. You have been a gentleman right through."</i></p>

      <h1>Professional Pride</h1>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Not a paisa more!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The stridency of the voice, speaking in Hindi, struck me even as I passed by a couple, the man arguing with a <i>coolie</i>. I glanced at the clean-shaven man; he was gesticulating angrily while the tall, dark and gloriously moustachioed porter stood with his palms turned out in conciliatory gesture, arguing his point with languid moves. I hurried on, a smile tugging at my mouth. The couple had too much luggage to really argue and settle on a 'bargain'.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Such scenes invariably give me a sense of self-satisfaction. I believe in travelling light. To wit, even then I had just a trolley-type small case—what they called, pretty artfully I thought, a <i>strolley—</i>that had been enough for the little job I had been visiting Calcutta for. With perhaps a jauntier step, I hurried toward the board displaying the out-bound trains.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">At any given time of the day, the Howrah (no, I cannot bring myself to spell it the new way: 'Haora'; all sense of romance is lost!) station resembles a madhouse gone crazy. Frenzied people any which way you glance. Harried fathers either giving in or giving it to their younger versions; mothers similarly attempting to put sense into theirs. When not in families, then singly, or in groups, people rushing each way madly, hawkers trying hopefully to draw attention to their variety of wares, insinuating themselves wanted or otherwise. Railway officials going about their own somnolent business, general gawkers gawking, beggars begging. Islands of people, in sharp contradistinction, standing motionless amidst the tumult, just gossiping, laying bare all matters under discussion with their sabre-sharp but impotent wit. In general, Howrah station looked just like it always does: itself.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Pushing past a man trying to pass through exactly where I was, I managed a glimpse of the 'Departure' board. A sea of heads, bobbing up and down, was before me, effectively making the board a pretty psychedelic display for me: here now, gone next! I am not a tall man you see.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I used my patent leather shoe to effectively squash a foot that, being attached to a man in front of me who was about a foot taller, hindered my sight of the board. A suave "excuse me!" and I had won through. Aah, much better!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">'Howrah Delhi Kalka Mail' was marked for platform number 14, scheduled to depart within the next ten minutes. A few more trodden feet, muttered excuses, one or two muffled oaths from the sufferers and I was out of that sea, heading fast for my train.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Platform 14 was a continuation of the madness of the main station. Dodging and weaving, I made for my compartment, A2. In the olden days I guess I would have said the train stood huffing and puffing. Now it merely wheezed. With a grin, I trotted on, blessing the railways for putting air-conditioned coaches closer to the head of the platform.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Providence, no doubt aided and abetted by the railway booking clerk in no small measure, had allocated me a lower berth, number 19. Sighing with relief, I stowed away my valise under the berth and sat down. I mopped my brow—although late October, the heat built up when one walked briskly—and tried to sense the cooling air supposedly flowing from the vents above.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Possibly seeing me look up, the passenger opposite me—at first glance, most ordinary looking a chap—smiled and spoke in <i>Bangla</i>.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, it is on. But the coolth will strike you only a little later." He smiled engagingly.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"<i>Coolth</i>...?" I looked askance. He had spoken that in English. Or whatever language he deemed that to be.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The man looked satisfied. I had spotted the word he had so casually tossed at me. "Oh, just like 'warmth'! 'Coolth' lends such an apt completeness to an inadequate 'coolness'..." He smirked.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Oh...", I muttered. I looked away, thinking, "Oh, he is <i>that</i> kind of a man, a <i>language</i> wit! Sure to push such gems on the others in the course of the journey..." A flash of my temper flared but I controlled it quickly. <i>This was no way to start a journey</i>, I told myself sternly.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There were just the two of us yet; two more passengers were to be expected. I looked at my watch. Whoever they were, they were surely not going to make it! Across the narrow aisle I noticed a lady sitting, reading a book. She appeared professorial; thick glasses with a neck-strap, grey hair, severely pulled back, and the corners of her mouth turned down. A vivid image spilled into my mind: <i>All she needs is a sharp...</i> I shook my head brusquely. This was not good at all!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Just as I thought I would pay a covert glance at the wit, I heard that strident voice, "<i>Not</i> this one, the next one! I told you!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Aah, my friends! They were also travelling with me? My mood swung in anticipated curiosity. The gloriously moustachioed porter appeared first, almost staggering under two large suitcases on his head, and slung on his arms were an assortment of smaller bags.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes! That's it! Stop there!" The voice preceded the man himself. The porter had stopped right in front of us. He looked at us and then at the lady across the aisle. She didn't look up.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"20 and 24, those are the berths," the strident one said. To be honest, his voice had toned down considerably. "20 on the right and 24 on the... left?" The bewilderment in his voice was so achingly innocent!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"How can they do this? Morons!" He glared at the wit, who looked at him and smiled gently.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The glare focussed on me next. I stared back. He said, "How very convenient! My wife has a berth at 20, an upper one and I have been given that one, across!" He pointed with his thumb at the berth above the professorial lady. The injustice seemed to burn him up.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The porter had meanwhile managed to stow away all the pieces of luggage and quite understandably, sought his dues.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Sahib, please check your luggage."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The strident one looked shocked at the interruption. As if noticing the porter for the first time, he said, "Eh? Oh! Here, take the money and vanish!" He took out his wallet and put some notes in the porter's hands. The porter had possibly made an astute estimation that further wheedling was not certain to yield too favourable results. He kept mum and loped away.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">It was only now that the woman—the strident one's wife presumably—appeared in front of us. A strikingly beautiful lady, tall and with very black hair in perfect coiffure, and wearing what seemed to be a silk <i>sari</i>, stood demurely.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You take this berth, eh, Savita?" The strident one—okay, so I still did not know his name—said indicating the berth above the professorial lady. The latter looked at Savita and scowled. Then he noticed there was another as yet unoccupied in our section. He motioned peremptorily at the wit, "What is your berth number?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">You had to hand it to the wit; he remained calm despite that tone. "21", he replied.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This irritating man was going to get it in the neck, I thought, knowing he would now turn to me. He turned. I knew I didn't want to listen to that tone—and be held responsible for my reaction. So I said without being asked, "Mine is 19. Mr 22 is yet to arrive."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The strident man looked a bit nonplussed. "Er, hmmm", he grunted.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">He quickly proceeded to occupy berth number 22. "Savita," he said, "you move to this berth. Whoever was supposed to come for this berth is surely not making it for it's almost time for departure. Even if that fellow arrives I will ask him to take number 24."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">That irked me some more. I did a few quick deep breaths, hoping to work out my irritation.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This couple was settling in and I was expecting the train to start moving any moment when the missing person, the sixth passenger in our compartment, actually arrived.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">He was panting, sweating badly, and patches of it cast strange patterns on his shirt. He stood there mopping his forehead, smiling apologetically; a small, tubby clean-shaven man, bald, with only a fringe of wispy hair around the back of his head. He was wearing a pair of off-white trousers and a gray shirt, and was dragging along a very similar looking strolley. But all these observations were automatic, without any effort from my side. My eyes were riveted at the man's face, my mind frozen numb, incapable of any rational thought! I realised in a vague way that my right hand was half-way to my chin to scratch and was shaking uncontrollably. I was in shock.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">You see, earlier in the day, about three hours back, I had shot him dead with my rifle. The little job I had come to Calcutta for, you know.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Without realising I got up and tottered off, vaguely shaking a hand at the wit who was asking me something. I walked down the aisle towards the exit in a daze, mind whirling. Meanwhile the train started to move, and I lurched in response, clutching a berth to steady myself. Then I was out into the cramped space around the toilets. The metal doors were shut. I opened one and the sudden rush of wind kind of awakened me from the daze. I gripped the side bars at the entrance and hung out a bit, feeling the wind blow into my face as the train gathered pace. It felt a bit better.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">A sudden vision of that man's bald head as it had appeared through the telescopic sight of my rifle, just a fraction of a second before a red flower had bloomed on its crown, caused me to grimace tightly. And I felt an arm tighten around my middle and a man saying, "<i>Kya sahib, gir jaoge</i>!" "Sir, you will fall!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I moved back in and noticed this man to be the coach attendant. He was now asking me if I was well. I said I was and sat on the small seat there meant for the attendant. I drew a cigarette out and lit up. The attendant shut the door and went off, no doubt to gossip.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had accepted this little job about a week back. In my usual circuitous manner, I had received the envelope with the target's photograph, on the back of which was his name and address. My policy being never to travel directly to the target site, I had hopped across several towns over three days and made my way to Calcutta. I had done my surveillance work over the subsequent three days, establishing the target's—I never think of them as people, it helps in my line of work, you see—schedule, idiosyncrasies, if any; any pattern that he followed and then picked the actual spot for the act, and scouted for a reasonably good spot—there is almost never a 'perfect' one, despite what you might read or hear—to shoot from.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I shot the target late in the afternoon outside his office, just as the rush hour was starting. I had noticed he stepped out for a cigarette around that time, before going back in for a final thirty minutes until closing time. I had made myself comfortable on the roof of a rooming house across that was mostly vacant at that hour. The roof remained empty till about early evening and there were plenty of staircases which increased the chance of escape pretty well.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I sighted my rifle through the narrow openings in the cemented railing on the roof. Using the head of the peon, a young lad of about twenty, who stood outside the target's office, I adjusted the scope until I could see each individual hair there. Then I waited, keeping a lookout through the scope. It was a simple matter. Eventually the target stepped out, bald head shining, stretched, and took out his cigarette pack.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Smoking kills, my friend," I muttered, while focussing on the crown of his bald pate. The skin came up clear. I could see some tiny hair and the shine of oil; apparently, he nursed it in the hope of coaxing some hair to grow back! I was grinning when I pulled the trigger and watched the red flower blooming for a second before I started collapsing and packing the rifle in about 7 seconds. I was off from the roof in less than 15 seconds. I had not waited to see him collapsing on the street.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I went down the three floors rapidly, the small backpack slung over my shoulder. The gun, you see, collapses into a 14-inch, four section pack, possible to be neatly hidden in a soft cloth bag or backpack. I used a parallel lane to exit to the main road from where I took a taxi to my nondescript hotel in Dharmatolla. I did not notice any excitement around that rooming house as I was leaving, but then it was too soon for that, wasn't it?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I checked out of the hotel, exactly per plan, and took a cab to the station.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My cigarette was out I realised, awaking from my brief reverie. This was inexplicable! I had actually seen the blood on that man's head and yet... there he was, hale and hearty, if a bit out of breath! For the life of me I could not understand the scenario at all. I considered the facts:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Had I hit the target who I was supposed to? Of course. I had looked at his bald head from up so close that I could even see the sparse hair on it.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Had the bullet hit? Yes! I had seen the red flower bloom. No doubt.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Does a .22 kill a man? Yes, it does, when fired with precision, as I had.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Could he have collapsed, injured, but not died? Remote chance, but possible nevertheless. But certainly, he couldn't have sprinted and caught a train 3 hours later!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Was I seeing a different man on the train actually? No! I was quite certain it was the same man, my target, who I had studied so very closely in the photograph and then in person, from a distance.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Did the target have a twin? Very <i>filmi</i> but a chance nonetheless. Three arguments militated against this:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">o    If such were the case, my client would likely have warned me of it. After all he would gain nothing by having the wrong man die.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">o    But certainly, a brother couldn't just dump a dead twin and catch a train to some place! I mean, not in the likelihood, right?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">o    In my three days of surveillance surely the twin would have surfaced? But what if he was travelling and had just returned?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had lit up a second cigarette while doing some tense thinking. Breaking that chain of thought I found it had gone out again. As I relit it, the wit came out.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You've been away for so long I thought you had left!" He was smiling. "Also, don't you want to place your order for dinner? The pantry car fellow is collecting orders now... if you like I could place one for you..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Eh? No, no... I had stepped out merely for a smoke." I realised I was not prepared to handle sudden queries. But this man was certainly quite helpful... "That would be very helpful of you. Could you please tell him I would prefer a non-vegetarian meal? Thank you very much!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The wit continued in <i>Bangla</i>. "No problem, no problem! You come in and we can chat until dinner is served, what do you say?" His insufferable bonhomie was irritating me nevertheless and in my current state I worried I could be easily provoked into something I would regret later. I composed myself with some effort.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You go on ahead. I will use the toilet and join you." I smiled lamely.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Good!" He smiled—apparently this fellow just never ran out of his good humour—and went back inside. And I stepped into the toilet cubicle. I had no urge; just a few more minutes to compose myself and face the man who ought to have been getting ready to be cremated.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">What after all was I supposed to do? My professional pride was severely stung, I acknowledged that. But the very mystery and the sheer impossibility of the situation had seriously rattled me, I had to admit. And of course, the consequences of failure had not escaped me either. You see, my line of work is based on word of mouth, and failure is sure to reduce a professional like me to obscurity and very quickly at that. My clients paid my rate only because I delivered every time. Often there were referrals. I had spoken to this client only once, over the phone—since I never meet face to face—and he had agreed to pay my price without a murmur. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My charges are not fixed. I look at the target, the location, quantum of probable risk, besides plenty of other factors. I generally ask the prospective client what he would lose if the target were to continue living. Most beat about the bush but revealed enough for me to sense the degree of desperation. And that helped me determine my fees.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There is no mechanism for returning fees in this business. Sure, my client could contact me the same way he had the first time and demand his money back. I squirmed in anticipated embarrassment. So, what could I do? The obvious answer was to complete the assignment.  But here, on the train? I wasn't prepared! I hadn't worked out the risks and neither their mitigation!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I looked at my watch; it was another 10 minutes since the time I had entered the toilet. If I didn't head back I was sure the wit would be back looking for me. With a final deep breath, I left there.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">When I reached there I found my co-passengers had rearranged themselves somewhat. The beautiful woman's strident husband was occupying my seat by the window; the wit was in his own, opposite him. Savita, the beautiful woman, was sitting prettily in the aisle seat opposite the professorial lady. And the man who had defied my carefully placed bullet in his head was sitting in his own seat, number 22. It was opposite him that I had now to sit since the strident one was in mine. I was in no mood to argue and just sat down in the only vacant seat.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The wit smiled a "welcome back". I had to return it as well. I was wondering what to say when he started.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Finally!" His genial tone was of course to be expected. "We were all wondering where you had gone off!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Oh just for a smoke, y'know." I was managing a fair nonchalance. But I also wanted to steer the conversation away from my abrupt departure. "When is dinner?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The bald man—he who had denied me peace of mind since his advent— who had been struggling with setting up his mobile to be charged, spoke up, "Yes, I really am hungry. All that running has really worked up my appetite!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">His mood seemed ebullient, as if designed to provoke me. The strident one was quiet, peering out of the nearly-opaque window into the dark night outside.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"So, how far are you travelling?" The wit was looking at me quite pleasantly. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Kanpur." That was of course not my destination, just my first point to change trains, onwards to my final destination in my customary circuitous manner, according to my plan.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Hmm... around tomorrow noon is your arrival then." He smiled. "We might as well spend the time more companionably, what do you say?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The innate friendliness of the man was insufferable, but I had to keep my cool.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The wit spoke again, "Kanpur. I am getting off there too. Do you stay there, Mr ..er...?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My response to fill-in the gap was automatic. "Dey, Rathin Dey. Yes, I live there. And you?" I gulped some water down.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I belong there but live in Kolkata." He smiled broadly. For the first time I noticed the perfect symmetry of his face. The high forehead, greying sideburns, and his mellifluous voice projected an image of quiet assurance, of command. His smile had the quality of winning people over. "And my name is Bisheswar Upadhyay."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Since each one of us had been speaking in <i>Bangla</i>, his name came as a minor surprise. His <i>Bangla</i> sounded perfect. The man who refused to die complimented him.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You speak perfect <i>Bangla</i>, Mr Upadhyay!" The bald man's smile was warm. "I am Mrityunjoy Ghosh."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I knew his name of course. It just went to confirm my belief. Even then it caused me a strange disquiet. It was the same name that was written across the back of the photograph I had been sent by my client. I had burnt and flushed it down the toilet back in that hotel in Dharmatolla as a matter of course.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Bisheswar Upadhyay was enjoying his brief moment of attention. "Living in Calcutta for 40-odd years would do that to anyone..." He was attempting modesty.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Mrityunjoy Ghosh carried it further, "Anyone who is willing to lend an ear to the local language, Mr Upadhyay, and is willing to learn it."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I felt I had to join in somehow to maintain the facade of the usual journey-enforced friendliness among co-passengers. "Yes, definitely, Mr Upadhyay."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Thank you, thank you." He positively beamed. He turned towards the as-yet silent strident man who was still peering through the opaque window.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Er, Mr...," He waved a hand gently in front of that man's face though at a discreet distance. That man turned. "Yes?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"No, we were just getting familiar to pass the long hours in some pleasant conversations," he smoothly drew us in to his question.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I prefer quiet in mine," was the most rude response.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This threw me quite a bit. Seldom had I encountered a ruder person! His wife had heard the exchange and it appeared to me that she was embarrassed by this boorish behaviour. She answered, looking at Upadhyay directly, and her voice conveyed her apology.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Actually, we are going to Delhi. It has been a very tiring day..." She left it hanging, her voice trailing off very artfully for us to gather her intention of conveying her apology.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Her husband glared at her and then at each one of us. I thought I would have to put an end to this. As it is I was feeling irritated. The potential for an unnecessary squabble was thankfully defused with the arrival of the ticket examiner.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">As we took our tickets out for him, Upadhyay stood up and peered into the chart in the ticket examiner's clipboard. Before the examiner could remark on that, Upadhyay offered his ticket to him. Soon his work was done, and he went further ahead. In his wake the deathless Ghosh took it upon himself to carry the conversation on.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Upadhyay, did you know..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I kept up a passing involvement in this general chitchat while the main thought in my mind was the insoluble mystery of this man who ate bullets alive.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Frankly, I have never been confronted by a conundrum so complete. The only persistent thought in my mind was of this man being shot and then living to sprint and catch the train. It just didn't gel. There had to be a logical explanation. My puzzle was to spot that. And I was failing in that repeatedly!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I determined to track it down before getting off the train at Kanpur. And then I thought of my other worry: My assignment was not complete! So, should I then make the attempt at fulfilling my commission on the train? I had very little time to plan. You see, I do meticulous planning for each and every job that I take. From travelling to the target's city—usually I do not undertake jobs in the same city I live in—tracking the target's daily routine, idiosyncrasies, local conditions, equipment to use—I do use guns mostly but sometimes a different tool is called for—and above all, my escape route.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">In this case, I was trapped in a railway carriage along with the target, for the next several hours. It would have to be in the night, as he slept. But that was too fluid a situation, quite to my complete dislike! Any noise could awaken someone else. As for escape, I could certainly time it such that I could immediately detrain after committing the act. But then that would crucify me as clearly as if I were confessing! There wouldn't be any room for suspicion, only for confirmation of guilt. And above every other consideration, these people had seen me.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">What then was I to do?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">At this point my attention was fully drawn by a direct question posed by Upadhyay.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Dey, where do you stay in Kanpur?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">No worries, I do my homework. "Kidwainagar."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">His response took away my sense of self-satisfaction. "<i>Arre!</i> I am going there too! What a coincidence! How far or close to <i>Chaalis Dukaan</i>?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I didn't get that at all! What on earth was this moron blabbering about? I couldn't let my expression change though. "Er... not too far actually." What on earth was this whatever-<i>dukaan</i>?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"How nice! I am visiting my brother who stays in 'D' block. Maybe we can go there together from the station?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Seeing my expression probably he quickly added, "I mean, we could get to Kidwainagar together and then go our separate ways..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">At this crucial juncture my nemesis chimed in. "Er, Mr Upadhyay, what was that you said about some <i>dukaan</i>?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My ears perked up. Upadhyay was only too happy to explain.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"<i>Arre</i>, that's an area in Kidwainagar you know. A market really. It probably started with maybe forty shops and thus the name... <i>Chaalis Dukaan</i>. Who knows? But it certainly is a quaint name, eh, Mr Dey?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was now on surer ground. "Indeed! I have often wondered..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay then changed tacks. "What is your line of work, Mr Dey? Going by your appearance I must say you are in some technical field..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This is something I have good preparation for; in fact, I am prepared with several options, each configured for the situation I was in at that moment. I let loose my preferred one, "I am a freelance software consultant."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I am not surprised, Mr Dey!" Upadhyay's face was beaming. "I'm seldom mistaken in my judgment you know. My guess was that you are in some technical line. Don't ask me how I know. It is just that I can guess." He continued glowing gently in self-approbation.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Bravo, Mr Upadhyay!" The death-defying Mr Ghosh was quick to second that opinion. Then he turned to me, "My son is planning to take up computers, Mr Dey. Maybe I can take some advice from you on that? I am a complete novice in that regard." His manful admission was loathsome. But Upadhyay had to naturally commend him on that.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Well, Mr Ghosh," I said, "Certainly I can offer some advice. But you know, a lot would depend on what exactly your son specialises in." One of the usual ways to defuse a situation like this was for me to go into some degree of detail and that, in my experience, put most inquisitive people off.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Mr Ghosh appeared a bit flustered, damn the man. "Maybe you can give me your mobile number and I will have my son call you up to ask his questions?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Indeed! I almost choked. Then controlling myself, I said, "Sure, sure." I quickly decided that if this man survived the night and remembered to ask for my mobile number again, I would give it. No problem, since this was my "being normal" mobile whose number I could freely share. My business number was different, one that I hardly bandied about.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay, the indefatigable, next posed the same question of Mr Ghosh. My interest was drawn again despite well knowing his line of business.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I am a small businessman, Mr Upadhyay. Nothing big. I deal in electrical goods in the wholesale market." He adroitly turned the question around to Upadhyay himself. "What do you do?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>'Small businessman'</i>? My ears had caught those words. From what I recalled of my conversation with my latest client—who I had failed, at least till now—this Mr Ghosh had swindled my client out of a sizeable chunk of money which he had wanted to get back; having failed in that he was looking for revenge.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay was probably awaiting his moment. He smiled expansively. "I am a retired cloth merchant." He made it sound as if he was a retired diplomat of international repute! I mean when would you hear of a cloth merchant retiring? Pompous ass, I thought to myself.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Did you know that Kanpur used to be a city of textiles? My brother and I were making excellent use of our mutual locations to run our business. He sourced cloth and I marketed it."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"From all appearances you did well for yourself, Mr Upadhyay," I remarked, rather drily I thought.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay's nature being what it was, he took that as a clear compliment, and thanked me quite graciously. And that man who had caused me such grievous agony, that Mr Ghosh, joined me in commending Upadhyay.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">At this juncture we seemed to be slowing down a bit, probably approaching Burdwan station.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Aah, Burdwan, I expect!" exclaimed Upadhyay.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You think they will serve dinner now?" Mr Ghosh was quite eager, it sounded to me, for food, blast that man!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, yes, Mr Ghosh. They should any moment now."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I hadn't noticed the strident man had dozed off with his head against the glass of the window. His wife now came forward and awakened him, speaking gently in Hindi.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Get up, <i>ji</i>. They'll serve dinner soon."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The man stirred and woke up with a scowl. What a man! I am sure any man with so beautiful a wife ought to be grateful and courteous. And way better behaved!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The strident man then stomped off, probably to the toilet. And his wife went back to her seat. The professorial lady had finally laid down her book and was rummaging about in a bag. Presently she took out a box, no doubt her home-cooked dinner. I laughed to myself for I can never fathom this peculiar desire some people have to eat their own usually gruesomely cooked food even when there is an alternative.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The train had halted. I squinted outside but could barely see anything. By the time the train started to roll again, the strident man was back and was enquiring of his wife if the food had been served. This kind of behaviour was causing me great irritation. Couldn't he <i>see</i> that it wasn't yet? It appeared that the couple was having a hushed argument. The professorial lady looked at them contemptuously and got on with her dinner. Upadhyay leaned forward and whispered to us:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"This man's name is Dr S. Kapila. I saw it in the TTE's chart, you know!" He winked as he said this. "Seems to me he has very high blood pressure, considering his irritability..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Mrityunjoy Ghosh agreed wholeheartedly. "Yes! I think you are right, Mr Upadhyay!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was spared from making any contribution to this needless gossip by the arrival of the pantry fellow with the trays stacked in his arms. I always marvel at the way they manage such large number of trays, orders, people... of whom quite a few were so petty and vindictive.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">While we were taking our trays, this newly-discovered Dr Kapila—how on earth could he be a doctor I wondered—brusquely ordered Ghosh off his seat.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You move to my seat, will you." It wasn't a question, you see. It was an order, flat in tone.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Something blew in my mind. "Who are you to order him off his seat?" My voice was raised, the tone quite aggressive; it had slipped out before I could stop myself.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The immediate silence was rather complete. I realised everyone around me was gaping at me, the professorial lady with her mouth open. And Savita, that poor lady, was blushing.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Dr Kapila's face turned red. His stridency was pronounced. "Have you noticed my wife is across the aisle and we need to eat together? Do I need to ask your permission before requesting this gentleman to offer his seat temporarily so that we might have our dinner together?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was amazed at this appalling man! "Request? Gentleman? Is that your tone when you make a request?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">By this time, Upadhyay had gotten up, and between him and Ghosh, they tried to cool things down.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Dey! Let it be! I have already moved... forget it! Of course, they need to have their dinner together..." Ghosh was speaking urgently.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Suddenly, the strange situation hit me fully. Here I was, standing up for a man I had contracted to kill, and there he was, trying to cool <i>me</i> down! Little did he know how close to death he was—and how incredibly lucky to be still alive. The humour of the situation got me and I started laughing aloud.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This caused even more consternation. The professorial lady was beyond all comprehension. Upadhyay and Ghosh looked stupefied and the Kapila couple appeared completely nonplussed.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Okay, okay. No problem. Now that you have already moved, this matter is settled. Let's get on with our dinners..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">And laughing still, I dug into my rather appetising chicken-curry and rice.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I realised I had to come to a decision. Should I complete my assignment or should I accept this failure? My professional record had only two failures, both in the initial years of my career. For the last thirteen straight years I had had only successes. My reputation had been built on flawless executions. It had reached such a height that I was called away abroad for assignments at least once a year while I never did more than half a dozen jobs in a single year. There had never been any comebacks from any of my assignments. The general public did not know me; no one ever recalled having seen me while on a job. I was a faceless professional. And therein lay the biggest contributing factor for my success. Anonymity, coupled with skill and meticulous planning with flawless execution had made me what I am. Until this twit came along.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My dinner was almost over. The conversation was general, harmless; desultory. The Kapila couple was still at their dinner. The professorial lady, who had not uttered a word till now, was done and was back at her book, primly poised, with her body language signalling contempt for the people around her.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay belched contentedly. Ghosh was back after washing up and his last cigarette for the night possibly as well. I muttered an excuse-me and went off for my customary after-dinner smoke.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I opened one door, and then sitting in the attendant's folding seat, smoked a tense cigarette. Try as I might I was not coming up with a viable plan to complete my job. Making a hit is never really the main problem. I was hitting a dead end every time I tried to answer this question: What would I do <i>after</i>?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The wind rushing from the door swept away the curl of smoke that would otherwise be so comforting to watch. I felt my plans were behaving in the same manner, being swept away! I bent my mind to it again, with more determination than hope.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">What were my options?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Lure target to this place near the door and push him out? And claim it was an accident?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Smother him in his berth as he slept at night? And pretend complete ignorance on waking up?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Use my piano wire ring—a fancy tool that I had picked up in Sicily a few years back while vacationing there—to slice through the target's throat? (Would be very messy.) And claim ignorance? (this was the same as the previous one excepting for the method of despatch)</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Then I realised that I didn't really have too many options; only the methods could vary. Making a clean sweep of all my fellow passengers was technically an option but simply wasn't a serious contender; I had not been commissioned to do so. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">It struck me that a supply of some delayed-reaction poison would have worked admirably. If I could administer it in the morning tea, this adamant fellow could be dead in half-a-day! I thought about that wistfully. But of course, I didn't have a ready supply of this poison. So then, back to square one!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Clashing with my professional pride was no less critical an aspect of my nature: prudence. I <i>never</i> take undue risks. One mistake can unravel all that I have built till now. This guiding principle has ensured I have never had to watch my back when I am not on a job.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">A sudden thought struck me. In the minor excitement of finding that Upadhyay and I were both getting off at Kanpur, we had forgotten to ask where Ghosh was going. So, what if I did some artful enquiry of Ghosh to determine where and for how long was he going, I could easily follow him there and accomplish my task. This thought really perked me up. I <i>didn't</i> have to take a risk here in this confined situation. My dictum had paid off. <i>Think hard, think smart, and never lose focus on the essentials</i>.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Feeling much better—for after all, one has one's professional pride—I decided to go back and put my plan into action immediately. But delicately.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The other things in this maddening business were:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">How<i> did</i> this bullet defying half-pint survive? I had seen him     with own eyes just before I shot him! Where on earth was he now off     to—thoughtlessly massacring my peace of mind and pride—behaving so     blithely?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">As I was getting up from the tiny seat, Savita walked out, probably to wash her hands. She smiled at me, and I cannot deny a thrill shot through me on seeing that perfect beauty in bloom. She dropped some debris into the bin and while washing her hands, said, "Mr Dey,"—she knew my name!—"I have to apologize for my husband's behaviour. Sometimes he just doesn't know what he is doing..." The clatter of the train ensured she had to raise her voice a little, else I am sure she would said this softly, matching the grace in her luminous eyes.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I hastened to assure her it was indeed a small matter and that I hadn't been offended in the least. A wild thought struck me. I have never commissioned my skills for my own self. But what if I did...? Despatched that abominable doctor and swept this beautiful woman off?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The intensity of the thought shook me! I was thinking like a carefree—and careless—teenager, for God's sake! I was a responsible adult, a man with a reputation to care about, and ought to act like one. Really!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Thank you for being a perfect gentleman, Mr Dey. I doubt if most people can be so caring and yet retain their balance."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Her compliment and the accompanying smile almost put paid to my tough act. A sense of embarrassment also prevented me from carrying on the conversation in this vein though I certainly wanted to make the most of this opportunity.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You said you were travelling to Delhi; do you live there?" I asked.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"No, no. We are going there to attend my sister's wedding. We live in Calcutta, in Salt Lake, you know."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There were other people coming out now to wash up and the place had got a bit crowded, small as it was. She had finished, and just as we were to go in, her husband stalked out.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"What are you taking so long for?" His voice sounded serrated. "I have been waiting for you, guarding the luggage from the thieving attendants and here you are, whiling away your time!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Savita was flustered. There were three or four other people crowded there and this was quite embarrassing. I thought swiftly: If I were to stand up for her she would probably have an even worse follow-up session with this boor. I kept quiet and went in without protest.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There were a few people who had already bunked down. But thankfully my co-passengers were still up and chatting.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay was naturally the person to welcome me back, again.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Dey! You keep going away for long periods!" His eyes shone with mirth. "So much smoking is not good for your health..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I smiled amiably—my intention was to pump the deathless Mr Ghosh for information.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Do you gentlemen intend to lie down right away?" I had to ascertain this in order to plan my next steps.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"No, no!" Upadhyay was quite categorical. "Let us chat for some time longer. We have been having a pretty interesting conversation, you know, Mr Dey."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"About what?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Nothing particular... The last topic was films. Mr Ghosh appears to a buff..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Ghosh the undying cleared his throat importantly. "I am a serious follower of Ray's films. Seen them all, y'know."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I am a minor fan of the great maestro Satyajit Ray myself though my usual taste in films ran to more <i>common</i> stuff, where I could lose myself for a couple of hours in a fantasy world, laughing without reason, with logic suspended.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was constantly looking out for the right opportunity to start on Ghosh while I participated in the casual chitchat. There were no intellectual pretensions from these two so consequently I did not have to really bend my mind to being subtle or sophisticated.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was yet to succeed in questioning the bullet-proof Ghosh when the strident Dr Kapila reappeared. Can you tell me how can a man be strident even when quiet? His wife was right behind. The good doctor then turned to us and said, "Which of you had berth 22?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I spotted the tense right away. "Had" instead of "has" which would have implied a notion of choice. This man did not believe in any scope for negotiation!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The unyielding Ghosh said in a mixed tone, "My berth is 22..." His voice trailed off uncertainly, yielding here pretty easily.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Was." His directness must have won him accolades in circles where being direct was considered just the thing. "I am sure even you have noticed that berth 22 now has stuff lying that doesn't belong to you?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">You simply had to hand it to this bruising stalwart. The bullet-digesting Ghosh was clearly stumped. Of course, there really cannot be any smart comeback to such a direct assault other than joining battle in the truest sense. And Ghosh did not appear to me to be of that sort; a rather peaceable bird.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Ghosh sat there in his seat, goggling. "I-I thought someone had just temporarily kept those pieces of luggage there... and would soon remove them!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Well, no. I have swapped that with the berth across the aisle, that one..." Dr Kapila pointed at the side upper berth. "My wife has taken this berth and you have that one. Any problem?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I wanted to really collar this oaf and plug his ears. Such breathtaking ability to sweep everyone else before his whims! I was itching to join battle.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">As I should have expected by now, Savita stepped in. Voice modulated just to the right pitch, she spoke in honeyed tones, "Mr Ghosh,"—she knew his name too, dammit!—"will you please oblige me by changing your berth with mine? Side berths are... I mean, I am very uncomfortable with these berths..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Before Ghosh could be swept away by the request, the blasted Kapila burst. "Aren't I already speaking to this man?" His voice was so raised that a head peeked from the next compartment, curiosity animating the eyebrows considerably.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Savita was of course not going to react to this latest provocation; she kept quiet. But the job was done. Ghosh was almost falling over himself to oblige.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Not to worry, Mrs Kapila,"—he had let slip the name inadvertently—"not to worry, only too happy to oblige!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">He had a silly smile on his face, wreathed in layers, that daft man! How I wished I could strangle him right away!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I will fit very well in that berth too, you know..." He looked at Upadhyay and me.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay, being a man who is never short of a response, said, "But of course Mr Ghosh! You will fit very well there, and the lady will be safer inside this area..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had a sudden desire to offer my berth to Savita now. After all mine was a lower berth so it was likely she would prefer it...</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Why don't you take my berth, ma'am?" I was careful not to use her name.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">That unmentionable Dr Kapila shoved his oar in. "She prefers an upper berth and therefore she'll take the one that Mr Ghosh has very kindly vacated!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This oscillation between perspectives was quite disorienting for me. One moment he addressed a person as if he were a slave at his command, the next moment the slave had not only attained freedom but had positively become a gentleman!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Savita, that fair creature, spoke softly, to me directly: "Thank you, Mr Dey. You are truly a gentleman... for offering your lower berth to me. But I will manage with the upper one, thank you so much!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Not manage, prefer!" said her husband savagely.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">And thus ended the latest fracas. The professorial lady—whose name we discovered later to be Mrs U. Sehgal—had a very bleak expression. Nothing new in that of course.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The dratted doctor was not done yet. "Do you plan to sit around for longer? I want to get to bed."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Nothing stops you from doing that. Just ready yourself and go to bed!" I just could not take it any longer.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Surprisingly, this mad fellow did not quite pounce on me. "Just ensure the lights are off."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Without quite a plan in place firmly in my mind, I made a mental note of the changed berths. For after all if I did carry out the assignment in the course of the night, I would require to be unerring in my choice of berth! So now, in this changed scenario, Savita was in berth 22 and my target was on 24. In terms of ease of access there was no difference really. However, a side berth meant more possible eyeballs if things were to go wrong. And I have a very strong abhorrence of anything going wrong when I am on a job.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The mad doctor turned out to be a meticulous bed-maker. He started preparing the bunks, ensuring the bed sheet were neatly laid and tucked in at the sides, the pillow puffed up, the blankets laid out just so. In fact, it looked entirely out of character. Savita helped him of course.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Upadhyay was chatting placidly, not necessarily of anything specific or directed at someone precisely. I was frustrated by the lack of an opportunity in finding out from Ghosh his destination. Since whatever was being discussed seemed so removed from this matter that I couldn't quite slide it in edgewise.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There was a lull in the conversation when the demented doctor stepped between us to lay the sheet out on Savita's new berth. Upadhyay murmured an "excuse me" and adding, "I will be back from the toilet before bedding down", went on his way. Ghosh was alone for a few minutes!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I decided to be direct. "Mr Ghosh, what is your destination? I quite forgot to ask you earlier..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The death-mocker was only too glad to update me! "New Delhi for half a day and then am on my way to Singapore to attend an electrical goods exposition there."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Hell! Before I could assimilate this news, he went on, blithely as usual, throwing my needs to the winds, "Actually my half day in Delhi is also for the annual electrical goods exposition now on at the Pragati Maidan there. I would have stayed there longer, at least another two days but the Singapore one has unfortunately coincided and that will be on for another two days exactly. And that covers a much larger gathering, more companies participate, more new products, altogether more exciting and interesting! But the Delhi one is essential since my local suppliers will be there..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Oh, I see!" was all that I could manage. Thankfully Savita stepped between us to do something with her berth, while her wild husband stood beside, scowling fiercely.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Bloody hell, I said to myself again. The kind of programme Ghosh had outlined for himself, without any consideration to be sure, completely did away with any chance for me to catch up with him there in Delhi! I had to detrain at Kanpur and then I was to catch another to my next hop before making it to my final destination. Even if I dumped everything and followed Ghosh to Delhi directly I doubted if I could simply knock him off just anywhere! An assassination is not a simple murder, for God's sake!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The Kapilas had moved away, Savita going off towards the exit, presumably to the toilet before retiring for the night. The crazy doctor lingered, scowling. Upadhyay meanwhile returned and started readying his bunk in turn. The remorseless Ghosh had started work on his as well. Only the hawkish lady across the aisle and I remained unready for bed, and my mind was a seething turmoil.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was back to square one with a murderous thump. The plain unfairness of the situation was now galling. I had made a fair and square hit, watched the body dropping and yet the target was right here, walking, talking, quite living it up, with every intention of flying hither and thither, fulfilling every whim! At that moment I knew, simply knew, that I had to get him. Else I would lose my self-esteem. And would then run the danger of having to hang up my gloves, having to fall back upon my savings to live the rest of my not inconsiderable number of years ahead.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I completed the task of readying to retire for the night without realising it and went off for a final smoke. I desperately needed to think. Think alone. So I headed for the tiny toilet.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The constant rattling in the toilet was most distracting but I persevered, leaning against the wall. The stink did nothing to alleviate that distraction of course. I tried to align my thoughts once more:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Was my mind made up on completing the assignment, this blot on my career? Yes, a resounding yes!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Would it help if I pursued the bullet-dodger Ghosh to Delhi, hoping to do my job there? Not too bright a chance of that really. Too short a time. What had this strange survivor said? He would be there in Delhi for only half a day. So there.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       What was left then? Here, in the train, was my only possible opportunity. <i>Now,</i> <i>I can only wonder how stultified my thinking had become by then!</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">So then? Nothing to it, I said to myself. In the middle of the night, possibly around 2 or 3 am, when most passengers would be more likely to sleep, I would do it. I knew there was a possible window of opportunity for about ninety minutes between the stations of Koderma and Gaya Junction that I could use. <i>Even this did not ring a bell! Goes perhaps to show how really rattled I was at that stage, how warped my thinking.</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I bent my mind to selecting the tool I would use. I preferred a gun of course but in this situation, that was surely unsuitable. The piano wire was also not quite the thing. I would then use the stiletto that I had in my valise. That would best serve the purpose. Expertly wielded, the person at the receiving end would barely realise something was amiss. There would be blood for sure but well, you couldn't make an omelette without breaking eggs, could you?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Once the job was done I would just step back to my berth and try to sleep; most certainly I would feign sleep till it was light. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Making my mind up made me feel a mite better. So now I had a plan, well, a sort of plan, that comprised a time window for the job, equipment to use, and the critical part of any such plan, what would I do next.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I looked at my watch and found that almost thirty minutes had passed. I thought of heading back again, and begin my mental preparation for my job. I stepped out.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Outside a very cross looking man gave me a disgusted stare and almost pushed past me into the toilet I vacated. He had apparently been waiting for quite some time. But then why had he not tried the other one? That must also be occupied, and he cast malignant looks at the first person who came out. I smiled to myself.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Quite a variety of snores assailed my ears as I made my way down to my compartment. What a cacophony!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The professorial lady was now primly lying down, the curtain not yet drawn as the death-defying Ghosh was just climbing on to the upper berth above her. I smiled at him, civil to the last! The curtains were drawn on my compartment. Inside, I found Upadhyay lying down but reading a magazine using his reading lamp. I returned his smile as well. I could not avoid stealing a glance at Savita but she was well covered under the blanket; not to blame her since it had become pretty cool. Probably asleep already I told myself. Anyway, from my berth I could keep an eye on her, breaking into a rather adolescent mental smile. Her husband was in the berth above mine and he appeared to be reading some journal, frown in place no doubt!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There were two immediate minor problems to resolve. One was to take my stiletto out without anyone glimpsing it and the other was to set an alarm for 1:30AM... now hold! I told myself. An alarm would make noise and I couldn't risk anyone else waking up due to that at that odd hour! Scratch the alarm then. I squatted on my haunches, drawing the valise out.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"What Mr Dey, you will read now?" I was almost startled. It was Upadhyay of course.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Eh? Yes, yes... just taking something out for that purpose..." Thankfully I did have a book in there that I could pretend to take out while I manoeuvred the stiletto out.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Never lacking in the milk of human kindness sloshing inside him, Upadhyay continued. "If you like you could read this book I have here with me. Here, take this..." He thrust a book forward, blast his good-natured soul!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I took it but responded, "Thank you Mr Upadhyay, but I want to finish my book. It is almost at the end, at a very interesting point, you see..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Of course, of course," Upadhyay agreed. He seemed to be in a chatty mood again; indeed, when wasn't he? "I am feeling sorry for Mr Ghosh. After you and I are alight at Kanpur he will not have much company, really."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I heard a grunt from the berth above mine. That oaf was probably feeling slighted by Upadhyay's comment. Serves him right! I decided to twist that a bit further.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, I agree, Mr Upadhyay. Maybe he will have to read some books or magazines to keep himself occupied..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, another about 8 hours after Kanpur..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">It was while that mad doctor's irritated comment on this when <i>it struck me</i>!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"People need to sleep. Shut up, will you?" I couldn't see him but could well imagine his expression. Upadhyay, who could see him, looked a bit startled, and started to make some conciliatory gesture. But I was thinking...</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">We were to get off at Kanpur around twenty minutes past 12. Another eight hours would mean... 8:30PM at least! <i>Why hadn't this occurred to me in the toilet when I was trying to make my plan? For of course Ghosh could not be going for the exposition at night! He would need to stay somewhere for the night, attend the exposition the following day before flying out to Singapore some time later in the evening! Contrary to what I was thinking, I did have a whole night in Delhi when I could do the job!</i> Bloody hell!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">As I lay on my berth, I was thinking feverishly. Should I then drop my current plan and postpone everything for Delhi? I would have to abandon my planned journey schedule, skip my connecting train from Kanpur and take another instead for Delhi immediately. I would also need to get the dratted Ghosh's address in Delhi, and that too without Upadhyay's knowledge since that fellow knew me to be dropping off at Kanpur altogether.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I groaned inwardly as I realised that Upadhyay was also expecting me to travel with him till Kidwainagar before I could make good my escape from his friendly clutches, haring back to the station to board my next train, which I could jolly well miss if there were any timing glitches.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The clash of the various variables, the moving pieces in this increasingly complex situation, was pushing me more and more towards persisting with my current plan of disposing of the deathless Ghosh here and now. That way, there would be next to no disruption of my plans. Of course, there would be a fair amount of ruckus on the discovery of Ghosh's death. But I was sure I could get away with some convincing act in front of the passengers and the police. I did not consider this factor to be too difficult. They could hardly start searching every passenger's luggage, though that measure, if resorted to, could prove to be rather difficult to cope with. I would of course dispose of the stiletto, dropping it through the toilet hole, but what about the rifle tucked away in my valise? For sure I was not going to drop that off too! I had designed it myself, built on a Dragunov SVD frame, trimmed of all fat, with a light graphite stock and slim butt, and simple bolt action. It carried no magazine—since I don't believe you can be in this business if you cannot do the job within the first two bullets, and you would barely have time beyond one single reload in case the first one missed or didn't do the job—and mounted a venerable Schmidt &amp; Bender 1985 model scope that accounted for parallax, bullet drop compensation, the works. I couldn't throw them away, could I?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Reviewing every aspect just confirmed in my mind that I ought to do the job now. The associated risks could be handled. Delaying would not necessarily ease the problem. I was convinced. All that now remained for me to do before dropping off for a couple of hours of refreshing sleep was to take my stiletto out. Or, why not do that at that time as well? I could not see any problem with that either.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I must tell you that I have this ability to tell myself to wake up at a certain hour upon need. It is like an internal alarm clock that I needed to activate when required and I would be awake for sure, give or take five minutes from that appointed hour. The intervening hours would be dreamless slumber.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The grumbling Kapila was quiet. Upadhyay had also just switched off his reading lamp, thankfully refraining from making any further conversation. Which looked to me the only positive contribution made by that mad doctor in the scheme of things!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I think I was asleep in the next ten minutes, having set my internal clock for a 1:30AM wake-up call.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I prefer to think it was my internal clock that woke me up rather than that tremendous drilling noise that assaulted my ears immediately upon waking. I soon realised it was actually real, giant-sized snoring that had sounded to me like a pack-drill in action. Nothing irritates me more than being woken up by something infernal like that. It was utterly dark, there was no night lamp on but as my senses sharpened, I identified that din as emanating from my immediate left: Upadhyay! Why, that so-and so! I exclaimed to myself. Then it struck me that this could be a good cover in case I made some minor noise. I checked the time; it was indeed 1:35AM, the train stationary. It appeared vaguely there was some platform outside: Koderma, I thought.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I waited silently, listening, listening. And could detect no other movement or noise, other than this massive, raucous snoring. At that moment, there was some slight jerk above me; the mad doctor turning over I realised.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I took my valise out silently. The catches didn't make any noise either. Soon the stiletto was in my hand. Nothing had moved or changed. I palmed it, turning it up, tucking it along my wrist, and swung back silently on my berth, sitting. I waited, observing, alert to the slightest change in the environment.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">All was quiet—if you could call things quiet with Upadhyay going full blast. I looked at Savita's covered form. She didn't appear to have moved at all since I last saw her. I couldn't see the now-not-strident Kapila above me, but I could sense the presence. I didn't have to look at Upadhyay; his audio output announced his presence most vehemently. I parted the curtains on our side to keep an eye across the aisle, where the curtains were drawn; there were no ripple of movement there. I wondered how anyone could possibly sleep in this racket but then even I had slept through some of it until I was woken by my internal system clock.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I usually nerve myself before such a job, particularly when using a more personal tool like the stiletto. The mind has to be free of all clutter, alert to handle any eventuality, circumvent a sudden—and heaven forbid unforeseen— circumstance.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I mapped the steps out in my mind:</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Move the curtains apart just enough for me to have access</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Spot the exact point to insert the knife—my target being between the fourth and fifth ribs on the left side (I had marked that Ghosh had laid down such that his left side faced outside; one stroke of luck for me, finally)</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Slide the knife in through the designated spot, holding the mouth tight</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Slide it out</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Wipe it clean, both blade and handle</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Go quickly to the toilet and drop the knife through the hole</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       Step back smartly to my berth</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">-       And lie down, hopefully without anyone the wiser</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">After the train restarted, I waited a further ten minutes, sitting quietly, not moving at all. Then, with a final breath to calm my nerves, I rose, the knife still poised the way I had been holding all this while: tucked along the inside of my wrist in my right hand. The Velcro fastener made a slight ripping noise as I moved the curtain apart at the middle. I let a few seconds pass as I accustomed my eyes to the dimmer space inside.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Ghosh was lying straight up, blanket drawn over fully. There was a vague murmur of a gentle snore, no more than a whisper: a gentlemanly snorer, I thought. Without further ado, I lifted the blanket as it appeared appropriate to me and could make out the form underneath as a vague and darker shadow. I made a swift estimate. I mentally marked the target spot accurately. Transferring the knife in my hand such that it was now pointing forward from my fist, I clamped my palm down hard on the target's mouth. It is precisely for situations like these that I have practised with steel spring grips such that my hold is like a vise.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Before this bullet defying Ghosh could cry out, I slid the knife in smoothly through the exact point I had identified.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Blood gushed out from that point, and the target stiffened, thrashing very slightly, his mouth straining under my clamped palm but to no avail. In a couple of seconds, he lay quiet, probably the moment the stiletto bit into his heart.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I slid the knife out and bunched the bed sheet and blanket as best as I could to stanch the blood flow. I wiped the knife on the body and that is when the light shone on me brightly, harshly.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The light from the electric torch was really harsh. It lit up the scene as if with a searchlight, shining upon a short man in indeterminate dark trousers, a white shirt that appeared to have a dark splotch on the front. He had turned around involuntarily when the light shone on him and in that even his chin appeared to be flecked with black ink drops. His eyes were screwed shut, left arm raised protectively against that light. And in his right fist appeared a long, thin knife that appeared to have some dark splotches as well.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The man with the torch had started to scream loudly: screeching, unintelligible cries that were blood-curdling but incoherent in terror.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Ghosh, Mr Ghosh, what happened, what happened?" Upadhyay had risen in a rush, quite disoriented, but shoving off his blanket. Savita had woken up too and was climbing down from her berth.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">From across Savita's berth, Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh was stuttering, incoherent and disjointed, "Loo-loo-look at-t-t-t th-th-is ma-ma-m..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">By this time Upadhyay had gathered his wits considerably. "Mr Dey! What're you doing with that knife in your hand?" His pitch was high, clearly high-strung. Meanwhile, there were other people from the compartments around that had woken, gathering but quite inchoate, totally confused. Savita, also down now, reached back and switched the main lights on.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">In that light—the torch still on—Rathin Dey still stood, looking stupidly at the knife in his hand. As Ghosh came down and stood beside Upadhyay, Dey looked up at Ghosh. At once a terrible change in expression occurred across his face. It visibly collapsed.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Y-you", he whispered, audible in the deathly quiet that had descended now. He could not take his eyes off Ghosh's face, mesmerised, terrified. "Y-you are a ghost... I have killed you twice now..." The words were uttered in a toneless voice, just above a whisper, disbelief the chief emotion discernible in that.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There was a gradual background hum building up, but Savita's voice was clear, above it. Calm in its deadly syllables. "You've killed my husband, you murderer!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Clearly, Dey was in no frame of mind to handle this. His look was of complete bewilderment, but realising who it was speaking, he turned towards Savita but could not meet her eyes; he dropped to his knees, his knife clattering on the floor. Behind him, the lady passenger, Mrs U. Sehgal, had risen, but one glance at the now visible constant drip of blood from the berth above her and the scene in front, she fainted wordlessly.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I looked at this pitiable man sitting across my desk, my mind quite churning with questions, bafflement and disgust, each in equal measure possibly. This despicable, so-called assassin—in my words, a hit-man, a killer for hire and nothing so romantic as an "assassin"—had been speaking steadily for more than two hours, confessing to his entire career worth of assassinations. But the very way he had been speaking, his asides in his confession—sprinkled pretty generously right through—told me that he was still entirely bewildered with the turn of events. Once he had taken a toilet break—permitted with a couple of armed policemen pointing guns from either side as he went about his business, reportedly in a daze—during which time I had called up various authorities. Of course, I had let the train depart after the pandemonium had reduced a tad, but delayed by several hours naturally.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had to detain several passengers of course, who I simply had to question and get statements from. But they had done so quite willingly, one of them even missing some important business travel plans. Indeed, that man was the pivot of the whole story: Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh. The others were this assassin's co-passengers, Mr Bisheswar Upadhyay, and Mrs Savita Kapila, wife of the deceased. There was another passenger in their compartment, Mrs U. Sehgal who had recorded her statement but refused point-blank to stay back for further questioning. She gave me her contact details. In any case she was quite hopeless as a witness as she had seen nothing before the event and nor after, when she had just fainted. The dead body was off-loaded as well. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Now I was waiting for the local police SHO to take over from me. Within sight of my retirement in my service with the Railway police, I could do without the unnecessary excitement; that was my sentiment. Though of course, a lifetime spent dealing with crime had given me the idea this was one of the most unusual cases I had come across.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Initial statements from the various people who I had questioned led me to believe this was a murder provoked by earlier quarrels. There were reportedly at least two quarrels between the deceased and the alleged murderer directly, but neither in my opinion was cause enough to commit murder; but then if you have been around in the police for the number of years I have been, you will know there are murders committed for far less provocation. </p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">One witness had mentioned the "surreptitious" chat the alleged murdered had had with the deceased's wife, Savita Kapila, near the toilet area on the train during the journey. This witness recorded his statement where he mentioned he had personally witnessed this scene, which was immediately followed by the deceased "walking in unannounced and cursing his wife". That was an angle I was looking to go into but when the so-called assassin started his confession all such thoughts fled from my mind.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Inspector Pandey, do you have any idea what anguish this has caused me?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I looked up at him. Despite having been at the receiving end of this man's candour, he still retained the capacity to astound me. "Anguish? I am not sure I understand you, Mr Dey!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Early on in the interrogation I had realised this man was a curious creature that comprised some old-world formality, strange charm of manner, passable wit and complete docility—at least the last certainly in this situation he was in. "I am an honourable man, Inspector Pandey", he had offered self-righteously. I saw no harm in maintaining a facade of gentlemanly urbaneness. Indeed, this man appeared to respond favourably to that.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes! Professional pride! The anguish of having your professional pride torn from you!" His face was animated, voice breathless, eyes wide. "In my entire career I have never had to fail so ignominiously, Inspector!" He broke off, looking off at the breaking dawn outside my office window. "I killed that man twice and yet both times he lived!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">When he had started, this so-called assassin who called himself Rathin Dey, he was incoherent, visibly emotionally disturbed. In fact, so disturbed that he had made no attempt at escape nor given any alibi or offered some cooked-up reason for being caught literally red-handed. He confessed right away, the under-current I thought throughout being his almost primeval desire to understand why what had happened that had happened!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had figured out the reasons behind the seeming mystery during the confession of course and had confirmed my doubts making those phone calls. But I will be getting ahead of myself if I were to launch upon my interpretations right away. Instead, let me offer the summary of the notes I had made of the statements of the three prime witnesses, the chief being the twice-blessed and twice-born Mr Mrityunjoy Ghosh.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><b>Mrityunjoy Ghosh</b>: I think it was maybe 12:30 in the middle of the night that Dr Kapila woke me up.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Ghosh, wake up."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I woke up with a start. I am light sleeper so it was not really difficult to do so. "What happened? Mr Kapila...?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Not mister! It is Doctor and you better remember!" I thought it very rude of him to wake me up and instruct me on top of that. Maybe I was a bit rude myself next.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Okay, Dr Kapila. Fine? Now tell me!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You will need to go to my berth. Now." Just like that! So sudden and so peremptory that I was quite breathless.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"But you asked me to come to this berth yourself!" You will remember Inspector it was Dr Kapila himself who had almost ordered me off my own berth earlier in the evening.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Doesn't matter! That man... that Upadhyay snores like a goddamn pig! I cannot sleep in that! So, you will go there, and I will switch here."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The injustice did not escape me of course. "I am a light sleeper myself, Dr Kapila! I am afraid I will not be able to accept your request."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Listen buster,"—yes, he actually said that, I assure you, Inspector!—"that was your berth, or okay, adjacent to your berth. Basically, the same thing! Had I not requested you to change you would have been living through that hell yourself anyway!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I am a peaceable man, Inspector. I hate quarrels, disturbances, all kinds of slanging matches. The very reason why I had stepped into the quarrel between Mr Dey and Dr Kapila earlier. So without much more ado I moved to the berth above Mr Dey's, who slept right through that without any sign of being disturbed. Dr Kapila also shifted right away—without thanking me of course—and probably fell asleep promptly for I heard no more from him. What a man!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I tossed and turned for quite a long time actually, probably just before the train reached Koderma. It was possibly sometime then that I drifted off. But it must have been only for a short while when I was awakened by some thudding noise. I sensed it coming from across the aisle. I found the curtains already pulled apart and so shone my torch. The sight that struck me chilled me to my bones! Mr Dey was standing before my earlier berth where Dr Kapila now was sleeping, and he appeared to be holding some kind of dagger in his fist! The moment the light struck him he had turned, and I could see the dark blotch on his shirt—which turned out to be blood when the overhead light was switched on—and his expression was completely demented! I shouted and shouted... until Mr Upadhyay woke up.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><b>Bisheswar Upadhyay</b>: Yes, Inspector Pandey, yes, I do snore a bit. My wife complains bitterly all the time, but you know, there are some things that one cannot help. And this is one of them. After witnessing that rather ugly quarrel between Mr Dey and Dr Kapila just before they went to bed I guess I must have read only for a short period. I slept thereafter and know nothing of any intervening incident. This switching back of berths between Mr Ghosh and Dr Kapila is something that I have no clue about.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">The next thing I do know about is Mr Ghosh shrieking at the top of his voice. Incoherent and demented it seemed to me.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Ghosh, Mr Ghosh, what happened?" I understand now that even I was shouting but I guess that was more in sympathy than due to any other reason.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">By the time I had got down from my berth I noticed Mrs Kapila had also awakened and was getting down herself. She switched on the light immediately after, but I had already glimpsed the scene as revealed by Mr Ghosh's torchlight. The sight froze my blood!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">There was blood dripping rapidly down from the upper berth across the aisle, the one I now understand Dr Kapila was on. And that nice Mr Dey with a long knife in his hand, looking quite mad! In a moment I realised what had happened: Mr Dey was provoked beyond words and had killed that very rude Dr Kapila while he slept.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><b>Savita Kapila</b>: That man is a loathsome murderer! Inspector, I can never forgive him, he has ruined my life! He has to be hanged. Only then would this place be a bit safer!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Eh, Inspector? Alright, okay, I will just tell you what happened and refrain from making any comments otherwise.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">This... Mr Dey had picked quarrels twice in course of the short journey, just imagine! And he had also accosted me out in the coach foyer, forcing a conversation upon me. My husband is... was a possessive but very loving soul, Inspector. He disliked some other man talking to me in that furtive manner. And being a gentleman, he scolded me rather than him who was actually at fault.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Anyway, just before we turned in for the night he requested that nice Mr Ghosh to swap berths with me which he did being the gentleman he is. But later, my dear husband was much disturbed by Mr Upadhyay's rather loud snoring and he woke me up. It was I who suggested to him that he swap his berth back with Mr Ghosh, who I was sure would commiserate with his misery. Little did I know I was sending him to his death!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>(Resumed after a break of about 10 minutes when Mrs Kapila composed herself after breaking down, poor thing.)</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I fell asleep almost immediately and awoke only when I heard that fiendish howling that I later identified as Mr Ghosh shouting.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I switched the light on and the scene filled me with dread! I saw Mr Dey standing there, dementedly staring at the bloody knife in his fist. And the blood that was literally flowing from my husband's berth told me what had happened: this mad brute had murdered my husband out of jealousy, hatred, and the hope of getting me. Yes, Inspector, a woman knows such things very well!</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">So there you are: The three main witnesses and their statements. Of course, each has its own perspective. Mrs Kapila's seemed a bit garnished to me but maybe her perspective would be coloured insofar as any dutiful wife's would be. While Mr Ghosh and Mr Upadhyay had mentioned the cause of the quarrels as more provoked by Dr Kapila's rather rude personality—indeed, their own experience with the plainly curiously behaved Dr Kapila was in-line with that—his wife had tended to gloss over that aspect. Understandably, I say.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My reverie was broken by Dey's plaintive question, "Inspector, what could be the reason for my double failure? My reputation—not that it matters now—is in tatters. At least if I can know the reasons I can cope with them. Can you help?" His expression was earnest, without guile.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I had already decided to tell this killer for hire my deductions that I thought were pretty accurate. I said, "Actually the reasons are simple, very simple.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Let me begin by setting up the parameters. Tell me Mr Dey, when did you reach the site where you shot the supposed Mr Ghosh?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Supposed...?" His bewilderment was pronounced. I had to ask the question again, channelling him.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I reached the site around 4:00PM that afternoon..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Very well. Meaning, you had not been there before that."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"No, no! I had followed Mr Ghosh to his office that morning, but then had gone off since I had decided to make the hit only later that day and there was no point in hanging around the site unnecessarily, increasing the risk. I had established earlier that Mr Ghosh almost never went anywhere else in the course of the day and did his business mostly from his office, receiving many visitors there."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Exactly," I said. "You had gone away believing Mr Ghosh would stay put the whole day until you did your deed."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"You mean he had left earlier that day?" Dey was whispering. "But..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I interrupted him. "Be that as it may." I cannot deny I was enjoying this armchair deduction.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Tell me now what you did after you went there at 4:00PM."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Dey was talking almost to himself now. "I climbed upstairs, on to the roof. The entire building was almost empty. I met no one as I went up. On the roof, I set up my vigil at the spot I had predetermined, screened from the door on the roof by a couple of half-finished columns. From there I commanded Ghosh's entire office-front. I assembled my gun, and calibrated the scope using the peon's head, until I could see each individual hair... then I waited, keeping an eye both on the watch and on Ghosh's stepping out for his smoke..."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"As you told me, you were sighting your rifle through the openings in the railing, right?" I asked.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, yes, that's what I did." He was a bit impatient.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"And you were keeping your vigil through the scope, right?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes, yes! I have already told you all these! Why are you repeating them?" Now he was quite annoyed. Annoyed, I ask you!</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>(Resumed after a break of about 10 minutes when Mrs Kapila composed herself after breaking down, poor thing.)</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I fell asleep almost immediately and awoke only when I heard that fiendish howling that I later identified as Mr Ghosh shouting.</p>

      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"That's where you made your fundamental mistake, Mr Dey."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mistake? You dare call that a mistake? Do you know how many years I have been doing this?" Dey thundered at me, probably raising his voice for the first time. Aah, stung professional pride. Again.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I was compelled to show some steel. "Shut up, Mr Dey. I am treating this as an intellectual exercise for the moment, precisely until the local police shows up. Then you will be gone. Forever. You get that?" I leaned forward on the desk.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Dey quietened, yes, but his curiosity being much aroused, he didn't react to this. "I am not concerned about that, Inspector. Go ahead, ask your questions."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I will come back to that. For the moment, tell me if you know the name of your client?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Yes. I do. His name is Natabar Das."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"And you know who this is, of course."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"But of course! He is Ghosh's ex-partner. They parted some time back on very ugly terms. That's what Das told me when commissioning me. He had started to explain his reason but I stopped him. These things don't concern me, I told him. I accept a commission and act upon it. The reasons behind such a job mean nothing to me. I also told him that if Ghosh had contacted me instead to decommission"—yes, that is the term this extraordinary hit-man used—"Das I would have done it equally competently..." He broke off here, only to continue a second later.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"That is the word I used, Inspector Pandey! 'Competently'! And look at me! I have made the most complete hash of it!" He shook himself.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I sipped my glass of tea that the <i>hawaldar</i> had placed before us. "Allow me to give you a brief background, Mr Dey."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Natabar Das had embezzled close to a crore of rupees about three years back from their joint business. That was the reason why they parted, and Ghosh also got Das to sign some legal papers giving up all claims on the business. However, on the pleadings of Natabar Das's wife, Ghosh refrained from pressing further charges and for punitive damages.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Six months ago, Mrs Das passed away and along with her went away all reasons for restraint on Das's desire for revenge.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Das must have been looking for some way to hit back. And somehow, he came across your services"—I almost asked him if Dey advertised for his services—"and contacted you. And you took the 'commission'.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Some of what I am telling you is obviously logical jumps I am making on reasonable assumptions and deductions, you understand, Mr Dey." Dey nodded dumbly.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"So, you did your surveillance, noted Mr Ghosh's usual routine. But since you didn't know of his immediate plans—what with Das out of bounds from that—you did not know of his travel plans.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Mr Ghosh left his office yesterday before noon. He went home, did some last-minute shopping and left early along with his luggage for a client meeting that otherwise would have happened at his own office. He left for the station directly from that meeting. In his hurry, he also forgot completely to charge his mobile. By the time he boarded the train it was totally discharged.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"That is where you came face to face with the man who you thought you had already 'decommissioned'".</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Dey's expression was sagging by now. But his tenuous link with reality was still persisting.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Hold on, Inspector! You're forgetting I had seen Ghosh with my own eyes... through the scope!"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I smiled. "I remember that perfectly, Mr Dey. But what you're forgetting instead is that <i>when you see through the scope set at high magnification, you only see a very limited view of the object you are sighting. Here you were only seeing the crown of a bald head</i>."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">You could see the truth slowly dawning on Dey now. He was crumpling before my eyes.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Y-you mean..." he whispered.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I changed tack again. Keep this killer unsettled. "Do you know what Das looks like?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Dey shook his head, uncertainty struggling with the pressure of dawning truth. "No, no I don't know that at all." His voice was hardly above a whisper.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I gave it to him without compunction. "Natabar Das was a bald man. Also."</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">A long sigh escaped Dey, his face ashen. His tea sat untouched before him. His expression was that of a stricken man.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">I covered the pending ground quickly now. "Natabar had come visiting that afternoon to Mr Ghosh's office, pretending to seek a meeting to ending their quarrel, rekindling a social relationship, perhaps? Or maybe he had come to gloat over his nemesis' death? See him one last time? I don't know... surely, he couldn't have known of your plan...</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Maybe that's something we'll never know. But he did visit that afternoon and waited for almost two hours, despite Mr Ghosh's staff telling him Mr Ghosh was off to Delhi and then to Singapore. Perhaps Das thought the staff had been instructed to mislead Das deliberately. Who knows?</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"I think his patience was running out. He had tried calling Mr Ghosh's mobile several times from the office, but his mobile was switched off, which is exactly what the recorded message says when your mobile has run out of battery, as Mr Ghosh's had. Which he had tried charging on the train, but something was wrong with the power outlet and it did not charge.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Natabar stepped out, and lit a cigarette. And you, Mr Dey, perched on that roof, sighting through that scope alone, saw only a bald head of a man who had stepped out at approximately the same time. And you thus shot your own client.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">"Strange justice, eh?"</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">My tea was finished, and my mouth was dry. This killer for hire was a completely shattered man, his confidence destroyed, and his life surely destined to be terminated sometime soon in the future.</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge">Just then, there was some commotion outside. My <i>hawaldar</i> came running to inform that Inspector Khan from the local police had finally arrived to take the killer into custody. As I rose to greet Khan, I noticed this strangely gentlemanly killer square his shoulders, as if he had finally come to terms with the hitherto impregnable mystery of the twice-blessed, death defying Mrityunjoy Ghosh.</p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>My hands are shackled. Like that of a common criminal. Where is my pride? My professional pride? The kindly Inspector Pandey had permitted me to finish my cold tea. I am walking down the corridor leading possibly to the jeep, waiting to transport me to a life I now cared nothing about.</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>Who is that? My eyes seem to be bleary, the images blurred. I can see it is a woman, followed by a bald man. Who are they?</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>A few steps closer, I see it is Savita. She is radiant in her black sari. The bald man behind looks like Ghosh, the invincible. I am not sure though.</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>Savita steps forward and says something to this new tall inspector. I cannot hear what. He nods his head and she comes closer to me. Ghosh is farther off, standing, waiting. Beyond, I can now also see Upadhyay. Perhaps my vision is clearing?</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>"You despicable murderer!" Her voice is so sweet. The words don't resonate to me. I don't know their meaning.</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>She comes closer. Now only I am in front of her. There is no one behind me. Does she hate me? Will she kill me? The inconsequential thoughts flash through my mind. I am unconcerned. She comes closer still. Now I can see she is smiling. Oh, so enchanting her smile! She comes even closer. I can reach out and touch her.</i></p>
      <p class="w3-padding w3-xxlarge"><i>She whispers. I can hear her. "Thank you, Mr Dey. You have been a gentleman right through."</i></p>
