    <h1>Professional Pride</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Not a paisa more!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The stridency of the voice, speaking in Hindi, struck me even as I passed by a couple, the man arguing with a <i>coolie</i>. I glanced at the clean-shaven man; he was gesticulating angrily while the tall, dark and gloriously moustachioed porter stood with his palms turned out in conciliatory gesture, arguing his point with languid moves. I hurried on, a smile tugging at my mouth. The couple had too much luggage to really argue and settle on a 'bargain'.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Such scenes invariably give me a sense of self-satisfaction. I believe in travelling light. To wit, even then I had just a trolley-type small case—what they called, pretty artfully I thought, a <i>strolley—</i>that had been enough for the little job I had been visiting Calcutta for. With perhaps a jauntier step, I hurried toward the board displaying the out-bound trains.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">At any given time of the day, the Howrah (no, I cannot bring myself to spell it the new way: 'Haora'; all sense of romance is lost!) station resembles a madhouse gone crazy. Frenzied people any which way you glance. Harried fathers either giving in or giving it to their younger versions; mothers similarly attempting to put sense into theirs. When not in families, then singly, or in groups, people rushing each way madly, hawkers trying hopefully to draw attention to their variety of wares, insinuating themselves wanted or otherwise. Railway officials going about their own somnolent business, general gawkers gawking, beggars begging. Islands of people, in sharp contradistinction, standing motionless amidst the tumult, just gossiping, laying bare all matters under discussion with their sabre-sharp but impotent wit. In general, Howrah station looked just like it always does: itself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Pushing past a man trying to pass through exactly where I was, I managed a glimpse of the 'Departure' board. A sea of heads, bobbing up and down, was before me, effectively making the board a pretty psychedelic display for me: here now, gone next! I am not a tall man you see.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I used my patent leather shoe to effectively squash a foot that, being attached to a man in front of me who was about a foot taller, hindered my sight of the board. A suave "excuse me!" and I had won through. Aah, much better!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">'Howrah Delhi Kalka Mail' was marked for platform number 14, scheduled to depart within the next ten minutes. A few more trodden feet, muttered excuses, one or two muffled oaths from the sufferers and I was out of that sea, heading fast for my train.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Platform 14 was a continuation of the madness of the main station. Dodging and weaving, I made for my compartment, A2. In the olden days I guess I would have said the train stood huffing and puffing. Now it merely wheezed. With a grin, I trotted on, blessing the railways for putting air-conditioned coaches closer to the head of the platform.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Providence, no doubt aided and abetted by the railway booking clerk in no small measure, had allocated me a lower berth, number 19. Sighing with relief, I stowed away my valise under the berth and sat down. I mopped my brow—although late October, the heat built up when one walked briskly—and tried to sense the cooling air supposedly flowing from the vents above.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Possibly seeing me look up, the passenger opposite me—at first glance, most ordinary looking a chap—smiled and spoke in <i>Bangla</i>.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Yes, it is on. But the coolth will strike you only a little later." He smiled engagingly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"<i>Coolth</i>...?" I looked askance. He had spoken that in English. Or whatever language he deemed that to be.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The man looked satisfied. I had spotted the word he had so casually tossed at me. "Oh, just like 'warmth'! 'Coolth' lends such an apt completeness to an inadequate 'coolness'..." He smirked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Oh...", I muttered. I looked away, thinking, "Oh, he is <i>that</i> kind of a man, a <i>language</i> wit! Sure to push such gems on the others in the course of the journey..." A flash of my temper flared but I controlled it quickly. <i>This was no way to start a journey</i>, I told myself sternly.</p>
