    <h1>Professional Pride</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Not a paisa more!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The stridency of the voice, speaking in Hindi, struck me even as I passed by a couple, the man arguing with a <i>coolie</i>. I glanced at the clean-shaven man; he was gesticulating angrily while the tall, dark and gloriously moustachioed porter stood with his palms turned out in conciliatory gesture, arguing his point with languid moves. I hurried on, a smile tugging at my mouth. The couple had too much luggage to really argue and settle on a 'bargain'.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Such scenes invariably give me a sense of self-satisfaction. I believe in travelling light. To wit, even then I had just a trolley-type small case—what they called, pretty artfully I thought, a <i>strolley—</i>that had been enough for the little job I had been visiting Calcutta for. With perhaps a jauntier step, I hurried toward the board displaying the out-bound trains.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">At any given time of the day, the Howrah (no, I cannot bring myself to spell it the new way: 'Haora'; all sense of romance is lost!) station resembles a madhouse gone crazy. Frenzied people any which way you glance. Harried fathers either giving in or giving it to their younger versions; mothers similarly attempting to put sense into theirs. When not in families, then singly, or in groups, people rushing each way madly, hawkers trying hopefully to draw attention to their variety of wares, insinuating themselves wanted or otherwise. Railway officials going about their own somnolent business, general gawkers gawking, beggars begging. Islands of people, in sharp contradistinction, standing motionless amidst the tumult, just gossiping, laying bare all matters under discussion with their sabre-sharp but impotent wit. In general, Howrah station looked just like it always does: itself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Pushing past a man trying to pass through exactly where I was, I managed a glimpse of the 'Departure' board. A sea of heads, bobbing up and down, was before me, effectively making the board a pretty psychedelic display for me: here now, gone next! I am not a tall man you see.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I used my patent leather shoe to effectively squash a foot that, being attached to a man in front of me who was about a foot taller, hindered my sight of the board. A suave "excuse me!" and I had won through. Aah, much better!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">'Howrah Delhi Kalka Mail' was marked for platform number 14, scheduled to depart within the next ten minutes. A few more trodden feet, muttered excuses, one or two muffled oaths from the sufferers and I was out of that sea, heading fast for my train.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Platform 14 was a continuation of the madness of the main station. Dodging and weaving, I made for my compartment, A2. In the olden days I guess I would have said the train stood huffing and puffing. Now it merely wheezed. With a grin, I trotted on, blessing the railways for putting air-conditioned coaches closer to the head of the platform.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Providence, no doubt aided and abetted by the railway booking clerk in no small measure, had allocated me a lower berth, number 19. Sighing with relief, I stowed away my valise under the berth and sat down. I mopped my brow—although late October, the heat built up when one walked briskly—and tried to sense the cooling air supposedly flowing from the vents above.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Possibly seeing me look up, the passenger opposite me—at first glance, most ordinary looking a chap—smiled and spoke in <i>Bangla</i>.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Yes, it is on. But the coolth will strike you only a little later." He smiled engagingly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"<i>Coolth</i>...?" I looked askance. He had spoken that in English. Or whatever language he deemed that to be.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The man looked satisfied. I had spotted the word he had so casually tossed at me. "Oh, just like 'warmth'! 'Coolth' lends such an apt completeness to an inadequate 'coolness'..." He smirked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Oh...", I muttered. I looked away, thinking, "Oh, he is <i>that</i> kind of a man, a <i>language</i> wit! Sure to push such gems on the others in the course of the journey..." A flash of my temper flared but I controlled it quickly. <i>This was no way to start a journey</i>, I told myself sternly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">There were just the two of us yet; two more passengers were to be expected. I looked at my watch. Whoever they were, they were surely not going to make it! Across the narrow aisle I noticed a lady sitting, reading a book. She appeared professorial; thick glasses with a neck-strap, grey hair, severely pulled back, and the corners of her mouth turned down. A vivid image spilled into my mind: <i>All she needs is a sharp...</i> I shook my head brusquely. This was not good at all!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Just as I thought I would pay a covert glance at the wit, I heard that strident voice, "<i>Not</i> this one, the next one! I told you!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Aah, my friends! They were also travelling with me? My mood swung in anticipated curiosity. The gloriously moustachioed porter appeared first, almost staggering under two large suitcases on his head, and slung on his arms were an assortment of smaller bags.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Yes! That's it! Stop there!" The voice preceded the man himself. The porter had stopped right in front of us. He looked at us and then at the lady across the aisle. She didn't look up.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"20 and 24, those are the berths," the strident one said. To be honest, his voice had toned down considerably. "20 on the right and 24 on the... left?" The bewilderment in his voice was so achingly innocent!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"How can they do this? Morons!" He glared at the wit, who looked at him and smiled gently.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The glare focussed on me next. I stared back. He said, "How very convenient! My wife has a berth at 20, an upper one and I have been given that one, across!" He pointed with his thumb at the berth above the professorial lady. The injustice seemed to burn him up.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The porter had meanwhile managed to stow away all the pieces of luggage and quite understandably, sought his dues.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Sahib, please check your luggage."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The strident one looked shocked at the interruption. As if noticing the porter for the first time, he said, "Eh? Oh! Here, take the money and vanish!" He took out his wallet and put some notes in the porter's hands. The porter had possibly made an astute estimation that further wheedling was not certain to yield too favourable results. He kept mum and loped away.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">It was only now that the woman—the strident one's wife presumably—appeared in front of us. A strikingly beautiful lady, tall and with very black hair in perfect coiffure, and wearing what seemed to be a silk <i>sari</i>, stood demurely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"You take this berth, eh, Savita?" The strident one—okay, so I still did not know his name—said indicating the berth above the professorial lady. The latter looked at Savita and scowled. Then he noticed there was another as yet unoccupied in our section. He motioned peremptorily at the wit, "What is your berth number?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">You had to hand it to the wit; he remained calm despite that tone. "21", he replied.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">This irritating man was going to get it in the neck, I thought, knowing he would now turn to me. He turned. I knew I didn't want to listen to that tone—and be held responsible for my reaction. So I said without being asked, "Mine is 19. Mr 22 is yet to arrive."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The strident man looked a bit nonplussed. "Er, hmmm", he grunted.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">He quickly proceeded to occupy berth number 22. "Savita," he said, "you move to this berth. Whoever was supposed to come for this berth is surely not making it for it's almost time for departure. Even if that fellow arrives I will ask him to take number 24."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">That irked me some more. I did a few quick deep breaths, hoping to work out my irritation.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">This couple was settling in and I was expecting the train to start moving any moment when the missing person, the sixth passenger in our compartment, actually arrived.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">He was panting, sweating badly, and patches of it cast strange patterns on his shirt. He stood there mopping his forehead, smiling apologetically; a small, tubby clean-shaven man, bald, with only a fringe of wispy hair around the back of his head. He was wearing a pair of off-white trousers and a gray shirt, and was dragging along a very similar looking strolley. But all these observations were automatic, without any effort from my side. My eyes were riveted at the man's face, my mind frozen numb, incapable of any rational thought! I realised in a vague way that my right hand was half-way to my chin to scratch and was shaking uncontrollably. I was in shock.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">You see, earlier in the day, about three hours back, I had shot him dead with my rifle. The little job I had come to Calcutta for, you know.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding">Without realising I got up and tottered off, vaguely shaking a hand at the wit who was asking me something. I walked down the aisle towards the exit in a daze, mind whirling. Meanwhile the train started to move, and I lurched in response, clutching a berth to steady myself. Then I was out into the cramped space around the toilets. The metal doors were shut. I opened one and the sudden rush of wind kind of awakened me from the daze. I gripped the side bars at the entrance and hung out a bit, feeling the wind blow into my face as the train gathered pace. It felt a bit better.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">A sudden vision of that man's bald head as it had appeared through the telescopic sight of my rifle, just a fraction of a second before a red flower had bloomed on its crown, caused me to grimace tightly. And I felt an arm tighten around my middle and a man saying, "<i>Kya sahib, gir jaoge</i>!" "Sir, you will fall!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I moved back in and noticed this man to be the coach attendant. He was now asking me if I was well. I said I was and sat on the small seat there meant for the attendant. I drew a cigarette out and lit up. The attendant shut the door and went off, no doubt to gossip.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I had accepted this little job about a week back. In my usual circuitous manner, I had received the envelope with the target's photograph, on the back of which was his name and address. My policy being never to travel directly to the target site, I had hopped across several towns over three days and made my way to Calcutta. I had done my surveillance work over the subsequent three days, establishing the target's—I never think of them as people, it helps in my line of work, you see—schedule, idiosyncrasies, if any; any pattern that he followed and then picked the actual spot for the act, and scouted for a reasonably good spot—there is almost never a 'perfect' one, despite what you might read or hear—to shoot from.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I shot the target late in the afternoon outside his office, just as the rush hour was starting. I had noticed he stepped out for a cigarette around that time, before going back in for a final thirty minutes until closing time. I had made myself comfortable on the roof of a rooming house across that was mostly vacant at that hour. The roof remained empty till about early evening and there were plenty of staircases which increased the chance of escape pretty well.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I sighted my rifle through the narrow openings in the cemented railing on the roof. Using the head of the peon, a young lad of about twenty, who stood outside the target's office, I adjusted the scope until I could see each individual hair there. Then I waited, keeping a lookout through the scope. It was a simple matter. Eventually the target stepped out, bald head shining, stretched, and took out his cigarette pack.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Smoking kills, my friend," I muttered, while focussing on the crown of his bald pate. The skin came up clear. I could see some tiny hair and the shine of oil; apparently, he nursed it in the hope of coaxing some hair to grow back! I was grinning when I pulled the trigger and watched the red flower blooming for a second before I started collapsing and packing the rifle in about 7 seconds. I was off from the roof in less than 15 seconds. I had not waited to see him collapsing on the street.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I went down the three floors rapidly, the small backpack slung over my shoulder. The gun, you see, collapses into a 14-inch, four section pack, possible to be neatly hidden in a soft cloth bag or backpack. I used a parallel lane to exit to the main road from where I took a taxi to my nondescript hotel in Dharmatolla. I did not notice any excitement around that rooming house as I was leaving, but then it was too soon for that, wasn't it?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I checked out of the hotel, exactly per plan, and took a cab to the station.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">My cigarette was out I realised, awaking from my brief reverie. This was inexplicable! I had actually seen the blood on that man's head and yet... there he was, hale and hearty, if a bit out of breath! For the life of me I could not understand the scenario at all. I considered the facts:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Had I hit the target who I was supposed to? Of course. I had looked at his bald head from up so close that I could even see the sparse hair on it.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Had the bullet hit? Yes! I had seen the red flower bloom. No doubt.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Does a .22 kill a man? Yes, it does, when fired with precision, as I had.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Could he have collapsed, injured, but not died? Remote chance, but possible nevertheless. But certainly, he couldn't have sprinted and caught a train 3 hours later!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Was I seeing a different man on the train actually? No! I was quite certain it was the same man, my target, who I had studied so very closely in the photograph and then in person, from a distance.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">-       Did the target have a twin? Very <i>filmi</i> but a chance nonetheless. Three arguments militated against this:</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">o    If such were the case, my client would likely have warned me of it. After all he would gain nothing by having the wrong man die.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">o    But certainly, a brother couldn't just dump a dead twin and catch a train to some place! I mean, not in the likelihood, right?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">o    In my three days of surveillance surely the twin would have surfaced? But what if he was travelling and had just returned?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I had lit up a second cigarette while doing some tense thinking. Breaking that chain of thought I found it had gone out again. As I relit it, the wit came out.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"You've been away for so long I thought you had left!" He was smiling. "Also, don't you want to place your order for dinner? The pantry car fellow is collecting orders now... if you like I could place one for you..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Eh? No, no... I had stepped out merely for a smoke." I realised I was not prepared to handle sudden queries. But this man was certainly quite helpful... "That would be very helpful of you. Could you please tell him I would prefer a non-vegetarian meal? Thank you very much!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The wit continued in <i>Bangla</i>. "No problem, no problem! You come in and we can chat until dinner is served, what do you say?" His insufferable bonhomie was irritating me nevertheless and in my current state I worried I could be easily provoked into something I would regret later. I composed myself with some effort.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"You go on ahead. I will use the toilet and join you." I smiled lamely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Good!" He smiled—apparently this fellow just never ran out of his good humour—and went back inside. And I stepped into the toilet cubicle. I had no urge; just a few more minutes to compose myself and face the man who ought to have been getting ready to be cremated.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">What after all was I supposed to do? My professional pride was severely stung, I acknowledged that. But the very mystery and the sheer impossibility of the situation had seriously rattled me, I had to admit. And of course, the consequences of failure had not escaped me either. You see, my line of work is based on word of mouth, and failure is sure to reduce a professional like me to obscurity and very quickly at that. My clients paid my rate only because I delivered every time. Often there were referrals. I had spoken to this client only once, over the phone—since I never meet face to face—and he had agreed to pay my price without a murmur. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding">My charges are not fixed. I look at the target, the location, quantum of probable risk, besides plenty of other factors. I generally ask the prospective client what he would lose if the target were to continue living. Most beat about the bush but revealed enough for me to sense the degree of desperation. And that helped me determine my fees.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">There is no mechanism for returning fees in this business. Sure, my client could contact me the same way he had the first time and demand his money back. I squirmed in anticipated embarrassment. So, what could I do? The obvious answer was to complete the assignment.  But here, on the train? I wasn't prepared! I hadn't worked out the risks and neither their mitigation!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I looked at my watch; it was another 10 minutes since the time I had entered the toilet. If I didn't head back I was sure the wit would be back looking for me. With a final deep breath, I left there.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">When I reached there I found my co-passengers had rearranged themselves somewhat. The beautiful woman's strident husband was occupying my seat by the window; the wit was in his own, opposite him. Savita, the beautiful woman, was sitting prettily in the aisle seat opposite the professorial lady. And the man who had defied my carefully placed bullet in his head was sitting in his own seat, number 22. It was opposite him that I had now to sit since the strident one was in mine. I was in no mood to argue and just sat down in the only vacant seat.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The wit smiled a "welcome back". I had to return it as well. I was wondering what to say when he started.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Finally!" His genial tone was of course to be expected. "We were all wondering where you had gone off!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Oh just for a smoke, y'know." I was managing a fair nonchalance. But I also wanted to steer the conversation away from my abrupt departure. "When is dinner?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The bald man—he who had denied me peace of mind since his advent— who had been struggling with setting up his mobile to be charged, spoke up, "Yes, I really am hungry. All that running has really worked up my appetite!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">His mood seemed ebullient, as if designed to provoke me. The strident one was quiet, peering out of the nearly-opaque window into the dark night outside.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"So, how far are you travelling?" The wit was looking at me quite pleasantly. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Kanpur." That was of course not my destination, just my first point to change trains, onwards to my final destination in my customary circuitous manner, according to my plan.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"Hmm... around tomorrow noon is your arrival then." He smiled. "We might as well spend the time more companionably, what do you say?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The innate friendliness of the man was insufferable, but I had to keep my cool.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">The wit spoke again, "Kanpur. I am getting off there too. Do you stay there, Mr ..er...?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">My response to fill-in the gap was automatic. "Dey, Rathin Dey. Yes, I live there. And you?" I gulped some water down.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"I belong there but live in Kolkata." He smiled broadly. For the first time I noticed the perfect symmetry of his face. The high forehead, greying sideburns, and his mellifluous voice projected an image of quiet assurance, of command. His smile had the quality of winning people over. "And my name is Bisheswar Upadhyay."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">Since each one of us had been speaking in <i>Bangla</i>, his name came as a minor surprise. His <i>Bangla</i> sounded perfect. The man who refused to die complimented him.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">"You speak perfect <i>Bangla</i>, Mr Upadhyay!" The bald man's smile was warm. "I am Mrityunjoy Ghosh."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding">I knew his name of course. It just went to confirm my belief. Even then it caused me a strange disquiet. It was the same name that was written across the back of the photograph I had been sent by my client. I had burnt and flushed it down the toilet back in that hotel in Dharmatolla as a matter of course.</p></pre>
