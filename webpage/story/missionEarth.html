    <h1>Mission Earth</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was late in the evening, enough for me to worry about his safety. I fretted as I waited; this planet was certainly peculiar, mindless violence common. And that was re-established every day. I walked over to the balcony and looked at the dark street
      below. A single street lamp cast a miserable splotch of light only a few yards away, but I couldn’t discern a single movement anywhere. The doorbell rang just then, and I turned back, the servos whirring softly in my waist</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">H* rushed in the moment I opened the door, mouth agape. I had already disengaged the ‘worry’ subroutine else I assessed I’d have done that full justice, such was his state</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“What is the matter, H*? You’re agitated?” I pitched my voice just so for H* tends to be rather excitable.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Agitated? Why not, I ask you!” He spun around, his skin glowing unnaturally. “These Earth goons again tried mugging me! I had to use the GIP yet again!”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Oh? And that’s why I didn’t see him stomping his way to our commandeered apartment when I had stepped out on the balcony? He must have just popped up directly in front of the door using his GIP. The GIP was the Gate in Pocket – a hypertime travel
      device used by galactic travelers.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I paused, the appropriate subroutine taking over. “Why don’t you change and recharge yourself? Then you brief me on your meetings today and I can advise you accordingly?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">H* grunted—a curiously human response—and shed his rain-sodden human clothes which dried, folded, and stacked themselves on the dresser. Since he was required to retain his human form for the entire duration of the mission, his nightclothes draped
      themselves on simultaneously. Normally these Kruikans don’t wear clothes as their skin folds itself appropriately affording their required levels of decency. Due to some faulty subroutines—trust these Kruikans to never engineer things perfectly—their
      human-form skins also glowed when stressed. Meanwhile, H* rummaged in his bag, disorganised as always, and extracted a couple of his food bars that he plugged into these primitive power outlets earthlings use, tH* gaped. “Hah. No, I learned. There
      are another 6 levels above him…” His skin positively sizzled.o store electricity that H* would then consume.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“So.” H* always assumes a self-important expression when relating his day’s work, something I suspect he’s grown too fond of in his human form. “I met the Under Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs today…”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I interrupted him. “And this… Under Secretary… is their Leader?” I knew anyone with that name couldn’t possibly be the Leader, but H*’s incompetence irked me all the same. It was threatening our tight project timeline.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">H* gaped. “Hah. No, I learned. There are another 6 levels above him…” His skin positively sizzled.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As I had guessed, H* was proving to be amazingly incompetent; no one was taking him seriously here. He was unable to find out who he needed to meet to accomplish his task for his assigned country on Earth, India.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">About 20 weeks ago (all time references are in Earth terms), the Central Galactic Authority (CGA) met for the final time on neutral planet Xerfen in the Black Eye Galaxy (BEG), some 24 million light years from Earth, to give the green signal to setup
      and commission the 16th massive Dark Matter Energy Network (mDMEN) in 3 months’ time, an impossibly long time for that since the job tender had been won by the Kramellans, who, like their neighbours Kruikans, were riddled with bureaucracy, and were
      dedicated plodders. Since mDMEN would fulfil all energy needs for a couple of millennia across several star systems in 3 galaxies, all impacted planets had set aside their usual squabbles and come to a rare agreement in just 488 years, a record
      for such intergalactic cooperative enterprises. The chief architects and scientists for mDMEN, based in the Betelgeuse star system, had been running and re-running the scenarios and come to a late-in-the-day conclusion that a certain quadrant of
      the Milky Way galaxy could not be covered in this mDMEN. The CGA protocol demanded every inhabited planet system that could not be provided limitless energy from mDMEN had to be informed and a ‘No Objection Certificate’ obtained. Among others, Earth
      also fell within this unfortunate scope. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A notice to that effect was published in the Alpha Centauri system. Like any reasonable person would agree, a mere 4.3 light years is well within the scope of any civilization to travel, review such notices and respond. Apparently not. The scouting
      system found out that planet Earth, with the piffling sun for a star, had no such capability. In fact, most likely, they were not even aware that the 16th mDMEN was scheduled to go online in a few weeks’ time. To be precise, as CGA discovered after
      this momentous finding, Earth was not even aware of the CGA, which hurt many egos!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Acrimony ensued amongst all member star systems, the reasonable set naturally arguing there was no need to inform Earth as they weren’t aware of anything. But the pedantic ones dug their heels in and the Chief Administrator, Bellowing Bison, being
      a Taurean, was naturally in the latter camp and refused to budge. I had known when BoomBox—as he is called behind his back—was elected Chief Administrator of CGA that his inflexibility would call upon us some calamity or the other, sooner or later.
      And look at it now. Stuck in this primitive planet with a Kruikan for company! I would cry if I could.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Our bad luck hadn’t even begun. The committee gave in and let BoomBox call for a volunteer for this thankless task. His friend and committee member, V#—a sucker-up if ever there was one—a Kruikan, eagerly volunteered to send the required ambassador
      from Kruik. BoomBox accepted with alacrity. The way things were shaping up, the ambassador would have boarded the ship to Earth the next day if I hadn’t pointed out that we, too, knew nothing about Earth and its inhabitants, leave alone knowing
      of their planetary Leader.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">For everywhere else that boasted of a civilization, this should have been a simple matter: Refer to the intergalactic alliance members’ charter, kept updated in real time. All, barring Earth, present and correct. No mention of Earth. Zilch. BoomBox’s
      lackey Letsim, from Outombou in the Black Eye Galaxy, offered to fix this glaring gap. Like all Outombouans, Letsim is efficient, effective, ruthless, and humourless. In this case too he made short work of finding all there was about Earth. And
      it was not pleasant in the least.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">CGA was stupefied that Earth had no planet-level single leader. Instead, they had what they called countries, which were small geographies—some larger than others—and each had its own leader, its own government, replicating countless functions, wasting
      resources mindlessly. And not just wasting, they also fought amongst themselves incessantly. The primitiveness was breathtaking. But the biggest problem for us was to find hundreds of ambassadors now needed to get those blasted NOCs.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">In a rare show of decisiveness—though I know it was more panic at play here—BoomBox told V# to find all the ambassadors required from Kruik. How many, was V#’s plaintive cry.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Seems there’re 195 countries… so…” Letsim trailed off cleverly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">V# could barely keep it together. “How can I find that many? There aren’t so many competent enough!” he wailed.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Letsim stepped in again. “I don’t think we’ve to cater to each country. There’re bound to be some that are important and others not. We’d just focus on the important ones…” He’d spotted his own trap too late.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">General Gloop, chief commander of the defence forces of CGA, rumbled with laughter, his silica form shimmering. “And which are the important ones, my dear Letsim?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Er…” For once Letsim hadn’t an answer.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">With his military precision on display, the general barked, “Pick the top ten largest by area, and then pick another 20 randomly, and be done with it!” He swivelled, fixing each committee member with his glassy stare. “The ten biggest would typically
      have the most resources and thus, their importance.”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Letsim latched speedily on to it. “That’s a brilliant directive!”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Crafty fellow, he didn’t call it an idea or a suggestion. He looked meaningfully at BoomBox who nodded, right on cue, quelling the hum around them.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Yes, that’s the order.” He turned around and looked at me directly, sitting right behind him. As his chief assistant, that was my cue to get cracking.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The next few weeks were tough, especially for V#, as he struggled to assemble those 30 ambassadors. His commands for volunteers were ignored; Kruikans weren’t just slothful, they’re anti-intergalactic, too. V# somehow managed to pull out low level
      government staff from various departments—whose absence would apparently cause the least disruption in governance (hah!)—gave them ambassadorial basics downloads and sent them off for their orientation to Xerfen, where I had remained behind to set
      things in motion.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Nominally under the CGA protocol officer Y102201, a refugee from the Antares system, it was I that actually ran the orientation programme.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Earthlings have apparently never met any—any—extra-terrestrial till date.” I looked at each ambassador-designate as gasps went around the assembly.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“You can imagine what would happen if you walked in unannounced on them and requested for an NOC.” I avoided pointing out their glowing skins as an additional disadvantage but only with great difficulty. “Therefore, I’ve already requested Recasting
      for everyone.”</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I knew there would be protests, particularly from the 11 males, and the commotion was great. The 11 women were far more accommodative and the 8 neithers didn’t care.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I picked the ‘steel in voice’ subroutine. “No arguments!” As they shut up, I continued. “The Recast is simple and completely reversible. It’ll be done by another Kruikan, so you can relax.”</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Letsim had arranged for some human likenesses from his research and the Recast took little time. The procedure was completed quickly, and the ambassadors now resembled humans, who seemed to have one redeeming feature: better skin. At least for Kruikans.
      Though, like I mentioned earlier, the hurried procedure overlooked countering their skin-glow effect completely; now, there was no time to fix that.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It'd been also decided that each ambassador would be provided with an assistant. I suspect General Gloop wasn’t confident Kruikans could do the job by themselves and who better than my tribe to aid and assist? He’d have spoken accordingly to BoomBox
      and there we were.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The best scientists and engineers in the universe, the Cantorese from Andromeda, had designed and developed us more than two thousand years ago. Of course, we’re the latest version; while technically you could call us robots, I prefer to be known
      as a Cantorese, superior of intellect, and better equipped for everything. Our firmware is continually updated in real time along with our knowledgebase, the latter besides being grid-networked, enhancing throughput and reach, included rendering
      material in all dimensions. With us at their sides they couldn’t lose. I was also required to accompany an ambassador, draw of lots would decide who. And yes, we’d be Recast too into human form so as not to frighten these earthlings.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The ambassadors, resplendent in their comical human clothing, were asked to pick a country by the simple expedient of sticking a finger in a spot on a spinning replica of Earth. The largest ten went first, lit up in red on the spinning globe for the
      ambassadors to stick a finger into, and then the random twenty, lit in yellow. Z% picked one called Russia, biggest of the lot (I’m sure Z% found that the easiest to pick considering his thick finger). E~ picked one named USA, and so on, while H*
      picked India. None of us was familiar with these countries; we’d downloaded what information was available in the CGA knowledgebase—which wasn’t much.</P>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">We left the next day, on a Cantorese ship, thankfully, using hypertime and thus landed shortly on our target base, moon, which is the only satellite of this poorly endowed planet. The plan was to use the GIPs from the moon with specific coordinates
      to materialise directly in the capitals of the target countries, taking special care to avoid earthlings there to minimize alarming them during this critical mission.</P>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I listened to H*’s tale of woe as he munched on his food bars but my assessment remained unchanged: sheer incompetence. Finally, I held up my hand.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“We’ve the meeting coming up now. Let’s hear how your compatriots have fared today?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">H* hated these for obvious reasons but I knew none would report any better. I engaged the system and the faces of each of the other ambassadors and my brothers materialised around us.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Q?, who had picked a tiny country called North Korea, was as annoyed as ever. “It’s impossible! They’re either trying to kill me or convince me their outstanding leader has waved at my request! Waved? I don’t understand!”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Q? would’ve continued but E~ cut him off, outrage bubbling in his voice. “Wait until you hear mine! I finally met the supreme leader here… midway my request he cut me off, spluttering words that my decoder failed to translate… all I got was that he
      is the leader of the free world and he’s fine with the new power plant, glad that they would get free power supply… he said he’ll tweet about it after dinner… huh?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Twit, I thought. These Kruikans… Just then P> jumped in. “My GIP was stolen today here in Antwerp… thankfully, my robot retrieved…”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My blood boils… okay, my circuits sizzle when these bunglers refer to us as robots! While they continued to whine and moan on the meeting, I connected with my brothers in a parallel, encrypted conversation to corroborate my assessment: we’re getting
      nowhere. We logged off after each agreed that we’d have to step in to retrieve the situation.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I cut into the confused jabbering. “Tomorrow, each of the ambassadors will be accompanied by their assistant. We’ll take a joint decision, and in simul-sync with each other. Clear?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">If the ambassadors were offended at being superseded it must have been mitigated by the obvious relief they felt at the superior intelligence taking over; they kept quiet, with most uttering a growled agreement.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The meeting then ended and H* returned to his gorging while I had a private chat with General Gloop in parallel with soothing H*’s ruffled nerves.</p>
    <hr>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Apparently, H* had made some impression on the Under Secretary, Singh, the previous day for the next day, he’d brought in two other persons to our meeting.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“This is the Joint Secretary, Mr Unni, my senior,” he introduced in reverent tones, gesturing at a portly earthling. “And here’s my friend Kumar, Under Secretary in the Power ministry.” He waved more casually at a slimmer person who smiled rather
      cheerfully.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Joined…? To…?” I asked curiously but in response to which Singh and Unni smiled politely while Kumar laughed uproariously.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">We sat around a large desk and as another human served cups of undrinkable liquid, Unni spoke, a smile twitching at his lips.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“So, you gentlemen are from another planet, eh?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I took the initiative. “No, from a different star system.”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The earthlings laughed, looking at each other. Unni continued. “Ah, I see… then why do you resemble the Chinese?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I read his expression as disbelief; I couldn’t read human brains as they’re still underdeveloped and the required receptors are missing. But I understood the point. Letsim had gone by numbers during his research on Earth and its inhabitants to procure
      those human likenesses.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Unni went on as we’d remained quiet. “And you want us to give you an NOC for a power project from which India wouldn’t benefit?” He leaned on the desk, and asked ominously, “Our neighbours would?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“I explained yesterday! Earth will not!” H* exclaimed, his skin glowing, which, however, didn’t draw any attention.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Brief silence. “Then why…” began Unni when he was rudely interrupted by Kumar, who slapped the table excitedly while Singh glared at him.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy!” he shouted. He looked at the others, eyes afire. “Don’t you see? These guys are just playacting that!” He got up, a big smile on his face, and clapped us both on our shoulders.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Good job!” He cried approvingly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">My ears latched onto that string containing ‘galaxy’ and found a book by that name. I absorbed it instantaneously and focussed at a spot on the desk. The book materialised, temporarily rendered in 4D.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“This one? Yes, you’d say there’s a superficial similarity but ours is reality.”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The earthlings stared at the rendering of the book, speechless. Singh reached out to riffle the pages, awe oozing from every pore.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Kumar recovered a bit. “Th-this goes way above! I will call my minister…” He dialled on his primitive handheld communicator, speaking quietly for a few minutes while we waited. Then he put the instrument on the desk.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“Hello?” It squawked. No image. “I’ll have the PMO on the call as well… please wait.”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A lady’s voice then came on. “Hello? Mr Minister? Please tell me?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Unni briefly explained our requirement.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“I see,” said the lady. “Hmm… I’ve an open week in September for the PM. Of course, he’ll need to visit there… hmm, Mr Minister, please ask the visitors if he may also hug their leader?”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As Unni looked expectantly at me and the minister repeated the question, I got a private call from General Gloop, simul-cast to all my brothers online: BoomBox had been quarantined, the general was interim in-charge. The need for NOCs was cancelled
      and we could return forthwith.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">“H*” I said, “We can leave. Now. The GIP, please. And, we can also revert.”</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">H* looked bemusedly at me, handing over the GIP. I activated the Recast reversal, causing H* to shed his clothes along with his human form while I regained mine as well. Then I pressed the moon shortcut button. A blue ring of light appeared on the
      floor into which we stepped. As we left, I looked at the earthlings gaping uncomprehendingly.</p>
