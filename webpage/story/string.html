    <h1>A Sting in the Tale</h1>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The sun had set by the time I reached the hotel to check in. I'd wrapped up my meetings in Dehradun by five in the evening and then cabbed it up to Mussoorie for a restful weekend before flying back to Delhi, and a refurbished life.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The hotel reception wasn't much crowded, just another guest either checking in or out, I didn't pay attention. I'd handed over the filled-out guest card and was waiting for the clerk to give me the room key, thinking of a chilled beer to start my evening, when someone tapped my shoulder.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Monk?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">None had called me that in decades! I turned.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">A tall, bearded man was smiling at me, his hand stretched out at me tentatively.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Biresh...?" I hazarded, extending my hand too.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The man laughed, slapped my hand away and hugged me instead, clapping my back.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Man! It's what... since school?" he said. "You bloody disappeared after that!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"But imagine running into you here!" I said.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Exactly!" Biresh exclaimed. Then, leaning forward, he tapped me on the chest. "Listen, buddy, what're you doing later tonight, eh? Say, after dinner? We must catch up!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The clerk meanwhile signalled he was ready with my cardkey which I collected. "Why don't we have dinner together?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He pulled a wry face. "My wife's with me... we'll be having dinner together but then she's leaving for Delhi while I'll stay back for the weekend. Something's come up for her there... Gotta speak to ya, buddy... Let's meet after dinner... in my room? I've a got a bottle of Blue Label... we've much to gas!" He winked.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I gave him a long look. "Fishy..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He laughed. "Good ol' Monk!" He squinted at his watch, made a face, and started to move away. "Remember! After dinner, room 1011, okay? Don't forget! See you!" And he went away.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I stared after him a bit, shook my head, then walked to the bank of lifts.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I chuckled to myself as I sprung a beer; meeting Biresh was good, reminding me of my youth. As I swigged my drink, seated across from the windows, watching the winkling lights, I reflected I had a good life. And it would get better. Surely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Soon after college, I had started my own construction business and over the years I had turned excellent profits with the result that I was now venturing into luxury living condos in Uttarakhand, that hilly state in north India. I had met several local vendors in Dehradun who were eager to partner. Things were not only looking good, they promised to zoom gloriously. It was heady.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I must have dozed off for a bit—the day had been rather packed—when I woke with a start, hunger gnawing at me. It was a little after nine. Dinner made an attractive image. Instead of ordering room service a meal in the restaurant downstairs sounded better.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">As I was stepping out of the room I noticed the door to the room opposite mine was open and a bellboy stood, possibly accepting a tip from a devastatingly attractive young woman who had likely just been escorted to her room. I nodded and continued without pausing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The restaurant wasn't crowded, scattered groups were dining. The maître d' showed me to a dark, quiet corner, my seat further obscured by a decorative pillar. I asked for a drink, deciding to nurse my hunger to a keener edge. People were drifting in but none sat near me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I had started on my refill when I saw Biresh walking in along with his wife. The maître d' seated them at a table only a couple across from mine but they didn't spot me behind my pillar. Biresh hadn't been too eager to have me join them so I kept to myself, which suited me admirably. I glanced occasionally observing them eating, and talking continually, which, at times, appeared tense to me. I snickered to myself and bent to my steaming soup.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was just finishing my bowl of rice and Thai green curry when I noticed a waiter bending over Biresh's shoulder and whispering in his ear. His wife paid no attention to that, furiously scrolling on her phone, holding a forkful in the air, unmindful. Biresh nodded, obviously excused himself and strode off. His wife immediately got up, stared after Biresh and hurried in the opposite direction, leaving her napkin on the table as had Biresh. Curious. The waiter had meanwhile served the Yam Nua and I started on that, spearing the fragrant salad mix with my fork.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Maybe a minute later Biresh hurried back, strangely furtive, glanced left and right, then fiddled with what appeared to be a screw of paper and poured its contents into the glass of wine that stood in front of his wife's seat, stirred it with his forefinger and left swiftly, heading towards the exit.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">What was going on? I was debating whether I'd interfere when his wife returned, behaving equally furtively. She glanced towards where Biresh had vanished then quietly swapped her glass with his. Then she walked back.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">This strange act had struck me dumb. What was going on? Should I do something? Hell, he himself had mixed something in her drink! A couple of minutes later, the tableau took another startling turn.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That devastatingly attractive woman I'd seen across my room literally sashayed towards their table and paused by Biresh's chair, looked this way and that, picked up his glass and drank the wine at one swift go. She plonked the glass down and walked away, a self-satisfied smile on her face.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I sat dumbstruck. What had I just witnessed? Just then Biresh came back and sat down. He picked his glass, looked wonderingly at it, then poured himself some wine. His wife too returned and they restarted their interrupted meal. Both now had broad smiles on their faces and their behaviour was discernibly more congenial. I'd finished my meal in a bit of a daze, wondering at the weird sequence of events. The waiter came by and I signed the meal to my room number, tipped the guy, and slowly left, avoiding them entirely.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I went for a walk, hoping the brisk air would be bracing. Which proved true, as I strolled along the hilly roads, wending up and down. There were only a handful of likeminded people out for a walk. It was peaceful, but try as I might focus on the upcoming changes in my life, the odd scene from a short while ago kept replaying in my mind. Who was conning whom? And that third actor?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">It was perhaps an hour later that I hiked back to the hotel, pleasantly tired, and looking forward to a small celebratory drink. I'd pop over to Biresh's after that. I chuckled to myself. My life was settling in. Finally.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I knocked back a stiff whiskey, humming a little air, and glanced at my watch. It was just after eleven. Time to go! I left my room, noticing the light still on under that woman's room door.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I'd remembered his room number, no problem. Surely, he'd be alone by then? I rang the room buzzer and waited, still humming <i>F</i><i>ü</i><i>r Elise</i> under my breath. Biresh opened the door, a big smile on his face. He'd always been a good-looker, even in that awkward adolescent age in the final year of school. He punched me on my shoulder.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Damn, Monk, you're bloody late! I'd missed taking your cell number else would've called you, man!" Clearly, Biresh had already begun drinking; his speech was mildly slurred.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Your wife's left?" I asked, looking around his suite. A separate bedroom stood to one side.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yup... Tilo's probably... huh... sit, Monk... let's gab, huh?" She had an old-fashioned name, Tilottama, though she was modern in all respects.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">We exchanged the details of our lives since school over the next hour or more, drinking steadily. Biresh seemed to be blessed with an uncanny ability to hold his drink, his speech still only as slurred as before and his eyes clear. I felt in a pleasant daze as well. His Blue Label was almost done, maybe a drink each left in the bottle.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Biresh had apparently worked briefly in a software major before quitting that and starting out on his own, setting up a niche software company about ten years ago that he had grown assiduously, employing a few hundred engineers. He was a dollar millionaire, he modestly confessed to me. I didn't want to get into a mine-is-bigger-than-yours game, which in all modesty, I'd have too; I resisted the natural urge.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You know som'thin', Monk, buddy?" he said after a companionable silence. There, I said to myself, time for confession!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"No, buddyboy... not until you tell me I don't..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That made him laugh until his eyes watered. He was more drunk than you'd make out. Finally, he stopped choking with laughter, gathered himself, and said, "I'm making... a new beginning, Monk..." he looked at me, a happy air around him, "only personally speaking, of course..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">So was I, I thought to myself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Go on..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He looked into the distance, at the open window, unseeing, before turning to look at me again.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Monk... I'm in love..." he looked at me, his eyes probing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I know..." I said, causing him to startle a bit. "Tilo's a good girl..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He sat up. "You... you remember her?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I smiled. "Of course! Who could forget her! The most beautiful, the most accomplished girl in our class..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He squeezed his eyes, still looking at me. "She joined class XII mid-year... her father was a senior government officer and thus she got admission..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yes, that was all over the school grapevine... yes, I know."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"But... you're there only the months till the exam... then you vanished!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I laughed. "My father was transferred and we'd to move. No other mystery, and hey, there was no Facebook those days else we'd have kept in touch..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He laughed aloud again. "I pursued her, Monk... really threw in all I had until she gave in. I won." He looked up at me. "I like winning, Monk... make no mistake of that."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I'm sure, buddy," I said mildly. "You can't build an empire without that drive..." I spoke from experience though he was least interested in such detail.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yup! We married and were quite happy too... we travelled a bit. I wanted a kid but she didn't and I accepted that, too... but... but things happen, things change, y'know...?" He looked quizzically at me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Yeah... they do..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He waved his hand, causing his drink to slosh, which he ignored. He pointed a finger at me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Two years ago, I met an extraordinary woman..." his face took on a beatific look.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Maya..." he breathed. "She blew my mind..." He gathered himself, and unbidden, he went on.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I hired Maya as a technical architect for my software product and we'd travelled together for a business presentation to the US for a week. She... she... we just melded without even realising, Monk, and couldn't separate ourselves. I extended the trip on pretext of business to Tilo... she didn't question me on return. I couldn't keep my hands off Maya and soon planned a trip to Europe, travelling to several cities."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He finished his drink and poured the final round from the bottle. "Tilo... didn't care, Monk, buddy... in these two years Maya and I must have visited over twenty cities across the world. We know we've to be together..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Divorce Tilottama then." I said quietly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I can't!" A wild look appeared on his face. "We've a prenup, buddy... cost me a million to divorce her!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Oh." I stared. A crafty look appeared in his eyes. "But Monk... remember, I win!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I grinned. "Hey, Bir, looks like we've run out of your Blue Label... I'll get a bottle? You okay to drink some more?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He gurgled drunkenly though his speech was as before. "Absolutely buddy... I can drink the night away!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Then hang on for a few, lemme fetch!" And I left for my room.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The room opposite mine was dark, no light under the door. Maya, I thought to myself. Couldn't be a coincidence. I chortled to myself. I lingered for a few minutes then started back for Biresh's with my bottle. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Biresh's room door stood slightly ajar. I paused for a second. Hmm. I went in. Biresh wasn't in the chair where he'd been sitting, and I heard a voice from inside the bedroom. A woman's voice.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I padded to the bedroom and viewed the scene inside. Biresh lay on the bed, blood streaming from his chest and belly, a large knife embedded there. His legs appeared bent unnaturally from the knees.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Tammy?" I called Tilottama.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">She was wearing a flowing red dress that accentuated all the right points. Delectable, as usual.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Ah, there you're... darling." She turned towards me with a broad smile. I noticed a large splotch of blood on her right hand. Biresh's. That was strangely arousing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I drew her in my left arm and went close to where Biresh lay, his eyes unbelieving.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"This is why you die, Biresh-buddy," I said. "We knew all about your little affair with Maya and we planned to settle your hash... didn't we, Tammy, baby?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"And Maya's, too. The bitch is dead in her room! I finished her! Looked like she drank the wine you'd spiked for me and which I had swapped with yours! It was an easy kill, too easy almost!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">That was the plan, anyway.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Biresh growled viciously. "You bastards!" His voice was weak though, life clearly ebbing away.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I laughed. "C'mon, buddy, you ain't no saint either!" I moved to kiss Tammy but she giggled away her face, slapping my hand lightly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Bir," she said. "I don't want your millions in prenup settlement... I want it all."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Biresh gazed at her, and if his eyes could kill us, we'd be dead instantaneously. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Oh, that reminds me, Tammy, our partnership papers are signed, registered and settled. We're equal partners in my construction company." I beamed at her.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"That does deserve a kiss!" She leaned in.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I felt a strange urge to tell Biresh about us.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"I never forgot her, Bir. And a chance meeting about six months ago in Bombay bloomed into something far more... Later, she told me she suspected you're involved with someone else and I set a private investigator on your tail. We soon had evidence. And now... y'know, huh?" I smiled at him. "Your millions will be handy for my firm to expand aggressively into these hills and elsewhere too... Tammy will pull her weight as my equal partner!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I turned to look at her. She was looking out of the window, at peace. She turned... but looked over my shoulder.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Before I could turn to see what she's looking at, a terrific blow hit me behind my knees. My legs crumpled, my shriek of pain shrill in own ears. As I lay on the carpeted floor, stunned, and beyond intense pain from my shattered knees, I saw a hulking man with an iron bar in his ham-like hands, swinging it up for another blow. And without meaning to, I noticed Tammy swiftly walking up to Biresh and pulling the knife out of his belly, causing gushes of blood to erupt.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The blow landed on my left knee again, and my shriek was toneless, my mind beyond numb. What was going on?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">She brought the dripping knife close and without pausing, plunged it into my belly, the pain of that melding with the pain of my mangled knees. I don't know if I was screaming for when she bent low to my ears, still grinding the knife, I'd hear her speak.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"You served a purpose, Monk... but you're a colourless yokel, hankering after my money and body. I prefer Hulk here." She pointed at that man with an iron rod, giggling madly. He grinned back at her, almost guileless.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"With both of you gone from my life, I can live the way I always wanted!" She smiled happily.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I couldn't register much through the traumatic pain but had to wonder at this demented woman.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"Okay, Hulk, our job's done here. Let's go! Bir's car is all mine now, officially! An SL500, all mine!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">With a final kick at my bleeding belly, she left with that giant.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">Biresh and I lay there, bleeding in companionable silence.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"So... Monk... you know how betrayal feels like, huh, buddy?" His voice was a mere whisper.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">I was whimpering in pain. "Huh..." I couldn't speak. I was going, fast.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">The last thing I heard was Biresh laughing, the sound macabre. "But I win, buddy... always. Money and planning..." he continued to whisper through his pain.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">"She's to drive back to Delhi... and I... I arranged for a bomb that I placed in the car... when I went out during dinner..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-large">He was still laughing when I drifted away.</p>

    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">It was perhaps an hour later that I hiked back to the hotel, pleasantly tired, and looking forward to a small celebratory drink. I'd pop over to Biresh's after that. I chuckled to myself. My life was settling in. Finally.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I knocked back a stiff whiskey, humming a little air, and glanced at my watch. It was just after eleven. Time to go! I left my room, noticing the light still on under that woman's room door.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I'd remembered his room number, no problem. Surely, he'd be alone by then? I rang the room buzzer and waited, still humming <i>F</i><i>ü</i><i>r Elise</i> under my breath. Biresh opened the door, a big smile on his face. He'd always been a good-looker, even in that awkward adolescent age in the final year of school. He punched me on my shoulder.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Damn, Monk, you're bloody late! I'd missed taking your cell number else would've called you, man!" Clearly, Biresh had already begun drinking; his speech was mildly slurred.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Your wife's left?" I asked, looking around his suite. A separate bedroom stood to one side.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Yup... Tilo's probably... huh... sit, Monk... let's gab, huh?" She had an old-fashioned name, Tilottama, though she was modern in all respects.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">We exchanged the details of our lives since school over the next hour or more, drinking steadily. Biresh seemed to be blessed with an uncanny ability to hold his drink, his speech still only as slurred as before and his eyes clear. I felt in a pleasant daze as well. His Blue Label was almost done, maybe a drink each left in the bottle.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Biresh had apparently worked briefly in a software major before quitting that and starting out on his own, setting up a niche software company about ten years ago that he had grown assiduously, employing a few hundred engineers. He was a dollar millionaire, he modestly confessed to me. I didn't want to get into a mine-is-bigger-than-yours game, which in all modesty, I'd have too; I resisted the natural urge.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"You know som'thin', Monk, buddy?" he said after a companionable silence. There, I said to myself, time for confession!</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"No, buddyboy... not until you tell me I don't..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">That made him laugh until his eyes watered. He was more drunk than you'd make out. Finally, he stopped choking with laughter, gathered himself, and said, "I'm making... a new beginning, Monk..." he looked at me, a happy air around him, "only personally speaking, of course..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">So was I, I thought to myself.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Go on..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He looked into the distance, at the open window, unseeing, before turning to look at me again.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Monk... I'm in love..." he looked at me, his eyes probing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"I know..." I said, causing him to startle a bit. "Tilo's a good girl..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He sat up. "You... you remember her?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I smiled. "Of course! Who could forget her! The most beautiful, the most accomplished girl in our class..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He squeezed his eyes, still looking at me. "She joined class XII mid-year... her father was a senior government officer and thus she got admission..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Yes, that was all over the school grapevine... yes, I know."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"But... you're there only the months till the exam... then you vanished!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I laughed. "My father was transferred and we'd to move. No other mystery, and hey, there was no Facebook those days else we'd have kept in touch..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He laughed aloud again. "I pursued her, Monk... really threw in all I had until she gave in. I won." He looked up at me. "I like winning, Monk... make no mistake of that."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"I'm sure, buddy," I said mildly. "You can't build an empire without that drive..." I spoke from experience though he was least interested in such detail.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Yup! We married and were quite happy too... we travelled a bit. I wanted a kid but she didn't and I accepted that, too... but... but things happen, things change, y'know...?" He looked quizzically at me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Yeah... they do..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He waved his hand, causing his drink to slosh, which he ignored. He pointed a finger at me.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Two years ago, I met an extraordinary woman..." his face took on a beatific look.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Maya..." he breathed. "She blew my mind..." He gathered himself, and unbidden, he went on.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"I hired Maya as a technical architect for my software product and we'd travelled together for a business presentation to the US for a week. She... she... we just melded without even realising, Monk, and couldn't separate ourselves. I extended the trip on pretext of business to Tilo... she didn't question me on return. I couldn't keep my hands off Maya and soon planned a trip to Europe, travelling to several cities."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He finished his drink and poured the final round from the bottle. "Tilo... didn't care, Monk, buddy... in these two years Maya and I must have visited over twenty cities across the world. We know we've to be together..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Divorce Tilottama then." I said quietly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"I can't!" A wild look appeared on his face. "We've a prenup, buddy... cost me a million to divorce her!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Oh." I stared. A crafty look appeared in his eyes. "But Monk... remember, I win!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I grinned. "Hey, Bir, looks like we've run out of your Blue Label... I'll get a bottle? You okay to drink some more?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He gurgled drunkenly though his speech was as before. "Absolutely buddy... I can drink the night away!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Then hang on for a few, lemme fetch!" And I left for my room.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The room opposite mine was dark, no light under the door. Maya, I thought to myself. Couldn't be a coincidence. I chortled to myself. I lingered for a few minutes then started back for Biresh's with my bottle. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Biresh's room door stood slightly ajar. I paused for a second. Hmm. I went in. Biresh wasn't in the chair where he'd been sitting, and I heard a voice from inside the bedroom. A woman's voice.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I padded to the bedroom and viewed the scene inside. Biresh lay on the bed, blood streaming from his chest and belly, a large knife embedded there. His legs appeared bent unnaturally from the knees.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Tammy?" I called Tilottama.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">She was wearing a flowing red dress that accentuated all the right points. Delectable, as usual.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Ah, there you're... darling." She turned towards me with a broad smile. I noticed a large splotch of blood on her right hand. Biresh's. That was strangely arousing.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I drew her in my left arm and went close to where Biresh lay, his eyes unbelieving.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"This is why you die, Biresh-buddy," I said. "We knew all about your little affair with Maya and we planned to settle your hash... didn't we, Tammy, baby?"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"And Maya's, too. The bitch is dead in her room! I finished her! Looked like she drank the wine you'd spiked for me and which I had swapped with yours! It was an easy kill, too easy almost!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">That was the plan, anyway.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Biresh growled viciously. "You bastards!" His voice was weak though, life clearly ebbing away.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I laughed. "C'mon, buddy, you ain't no saint either!" I moved to kiss Tammy but she giggled away her face, slapping my hand lightly.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Bir," she said. "I don't want your millions in prenup settlement... I want it all."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Biresh gazed at her, and if his eyes could kill us, we'd be dead instantaneously. </p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Oh, that reminds me, Tammy, our partnership papers are signed, registered and settled. We're equal partners in my construction company." I beamed at her.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"That does deserve a kiss!" She leaned in.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I felt a strange urge to tell Biresh about us.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"I never forgot her, Bir. And a chance meeting about six months ago in Bombay bloomed into something far more... Later, she told me she suspected you're involved with someone else and I set a private investigator on your tail. We soon had evidence. And now... y'know, huh?" I smiled at him. "Your millions will be handy for my firm to expand aggressively into these hills and elsewhere too... Tammy will pull her weight as my equal partner!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I turned to look at her. She was looking out of the window, at peace. She turned... but looked over my shoulder.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Before I could turn to see what she's looking at, a terrific blow hit me behind my knees. My legs crumpled, my shriek of pain shrill in own ears. As I lay on the carpeted floor, stunned, and beyond intense pain from my shattered knees, I saw a hulking man with an iron bar in his ham-like hands, swinging it up for another blow. And without meaning to, I noticed Tammy swiftly walking up to Biresh and pulling the knife out of his belly, causing gushes of blood to erupt.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The blow landed on my left knee again, and my shriek was toneless, my mind beyond numb. What was going on?</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">She brought the dripping knife close and without pausing, plunged it into my belly, the pain of that melding with the pain of my mangled knees. I don't know if I was screaming for when she bent low to my ears, still grinding the knife, I'd hear her speak.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"You served a purpose, Monk... but you're a colourless yokel, hankering after my money and body. I prefer Hulk here." She pointed at that man with an iron rod, giggling madly. He grinned back at her, almost guileless.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"With both of you gone from my life, I can live the way I always wanted!" She smiled happily.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I couldn't register much through the traumatic pain but had to wonder at this demented woman.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"Okay, Hulk, our job's done here. Let's go! Bir's car is all mine now, officially! An SL500, all mine!"</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">With a final kick at my bleeding belly, she left with that giant.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">Biresh and I lay there, bleeding in companionable silence.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"So... Monk... you know how betrayal feels like, huh, buddy?" His voice was a mere whisper.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">I was whimpering in pain. "Huh..." I couldn't speak. I was going, fast.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">The last thing I heard was Biresh laughing, the sound macabre. "But I win, buddy... always. Money and planning..." he continued to whisper through his pain.</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">"She's to drive back to Delhi... and I... I arranged for a bomb that I placed in the car... when I went out during dinner..."</p>
    <p class="w3-padding w3-xxxlarge">He was still laughing when I drifted away.</p>
